--- Fix for TCP Connection File Descriptor Exhaustion ---

The issue is that the retry logic in retry_tcp_connection is creating multiple file descriptors 
without properly cleaning up failed connections. 

IMMEDIATE FIX:
1. Restart the container to clear all existing connections
2. Set environment variable to use a single connection attempt initially
3. Implement connection pooling

The key issue is in /workspace/ext/src/utils/network/mod.rs where retry_tcp_connection
keeps creating new connections without properly closing failed ones.

QUICK FIX - Add to docker-compose.yml for visionflow_container:
  environment:
    - CLAUDE_FLOW_HOST=multi-agent-container
    - MCP_TCP_PORT=9500
    - RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS=1
  ulimits:
    nofile:
      soft: 65536
      hard: 65536

This will:
1. Ensure correct host is used in Docker environment
2. Limit retry attempts to prevent file descriptor exhaustion  
3. Increase file descriptor limits as a safety measure

After applying these changes:
1. docker-compose down
2. docker-compose up -d --build visionflow_container
3. The ClaudeFlowActor should connect successfully on first attempt
