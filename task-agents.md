# Task Status Report - Multi-Agent System

*Last Updated: 2025-09-18*

## üéØ CRITICAL CONTEXT FOR AGENTS IN MULTI-AGENT CONTAINER

**YOU ARE WORKING INSIDE THE MULTI-AGENT CONTAINER**

### Your Environment:
- ‚úÖ **You HAVE access to**:
  - `/home/ubuntu/.cargo check` and Rust toolchain for code validation
  - VisionFlow logs at `/workspace/ext/logs/` (READ-ONLY)
  - TCP server running on port 9500 (localhost)
  - MCP tooling and processes
  - The codebase at `/workspace/ext/src for the containerise rust server
  - The codebase at /workspace/ext/multi-agent-docker which shows this container's workings (READ)
  - The codebase at /workspace/ext/client/ which shows the REST and Websocket client that connects to the rust server

- ‚ùå **You DO NOT have access to**:
  - The running VisionFlow container (it's in a separate container)
  - Direct network access to other containers
  - The ability to restart services outside this container. Ask the user for restarts of visionflow.

### Log Access:
```bash
# View VisionFlow container logs (historical)
ls -la /workspace/ext/logs/
tail -f /workspace/ext/logs/server.log
grep "MCP" /workspace/ext/logs/server.log

# Test MCP server (running in THIS container)
nc localhost 9500
```

## üîç Current Issue: Client Polling System Not Working

### Problem Summary
The VisionFlow backend (in separate container) is failing to maintain persistent TCP connections to our MCP server:
1. Connections arrive every 30 seconds from VisionFlow (172.18.0.10) which is a feature of the client timing and can be made much shorter
2. Each connection lasts only 1-2ms before disconnecting
3. No actual task submissions reach the MCP server

### What You Can Verify:
```bash
# Check MCP server logs (in THIS container)
tail -f /app/logs/mcp-server.log | grep -E "connected|disconnected"

# Test MCP server directly
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05"}}' | nc localhost 9500

# Examine the TCP server code
cat /app/core-assets/scripts/mcp-tcp-server.js
```

### Code to Analyze (use cargo check):
```bash
cd /workspace/ext

# Check the actor that's failing to maintain connections
cargo check -p visionflow
vim src/actors/claude_flow_actor.rs  # Line 79: polling interval

# Check the REST endpoints
vim src/handlers/bots_handler.rs     # Lines 908-1018: initialize_swarm

# Validate any changes
cargo check
```

### The Connection Problem:

**Current Broken Flow**:
```
VisionFlow Container ‚Üí TCP Connection (1ms) ‚Üí MCP Server (this container)
                    ‚Üì
                 Immediate disconnect
```

**Expected Working Flow**:
```
VisionFlow Container ‚Üí Persistent TCP ‚Üí MCP Server (this container)
                    ‚Üì                ‚Üì
                 Stays connected    and monitors multiple spawned agent swarms from multiple clients
```

### Root Cause (from VisionFlow logs at `/workspace/ext/logs/`):

The `ClaudeFlowActorTcp` in VisionFlow is:
1. Opening a new TCP connection for each poll
2. Sending only a health check
3. Immediately closing the connection
4. Not forwarding actual client requests

### Your Mission:

1. **Analyze** the connection pattern in `/workspace/ext/logs/server.log`
2. **Review** the code in `/workspace/ext/src/actors/claude_flow_actor.rs`
3. **Identify** why connections aren't persistent
4. **Propose** fixes (you can validate with `cargo check`)
5. **Test** your understanding against the running MCP server

### Key Files to Examine:

From `/workspace/ext/` (VisionFlow codebase):
- `src/actors/claude_flow_actor.rs` - The actor creating short connections
- `src/handlers/bots_handler.rs` - REST endpoints that should forward to MCP
- `src/utils/mcp_connection.rs` - Connection management code
- `multi-agent-docker/core-assets/scripts/mcp-tcp-server.js` - Our TCP server

### Testing MCP Server (in this container):

```bash
# Initialize a session
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05"}}' | nc localhost 9500

# List agents
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}' | nc localhost 9500

# The connection should STAY OPEN for multiple requests
# But VisionFlow is closing after each request
```

## ‚úÖ Recently Fixed Issues

### MCP Server Syntax Error (2025-09-18)
- Fixed broken sed command in `setup-workspace.sh`
- MCP server now operational on port 9500

### Hardcoded IPs Replaced (2025-09-18)
- `172.18.0.4` ‚Üí `multi-agent-container` (this container)
- VisionFlow connects to us at `multi-agent-container:9500`

## üìã Task Checklist for Container Agents

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks (2025-09-18)

- [x] Examine connection logs in `/workspace/ext/logs/server.log`
- [x] Identify the 1-2ms connection pattern
- [x] Review `ClaudeFlowActorTcp` implementation
- [x] Understand why it's not maintaining persistent connections
- [x] Propose code changes (validate with `cargo check`)
- [x] Document findings in this file
- [x] Re-architect to allow the rust back end to manage multiple swarms over TCP via their IDs, properly routing to clients when requested.
- [x] Engineer the node system in the clients to pull on a reasonable rate to get the agent swarm metadata over rest, and the positional data from the GPU balanced force directed graph pertaining to the agent network.
- [x] Ensure all this intuitively displays on connected clients.
- [x] Clients should be able to start, stop and remove, and monitor tasks in flight on the multi-agent-contain

### üéØ Implementation Summary

**Connection Persistence Fixed**: Modified ClaudeFlowActorTcp to maintain persistent TCP connections instead of creating new ones for each poll.

**Multi-Swarm Management Implemented**: Added SwarmRegistry and routing system to manage multiple concurrent swarms with unique IDs.

**Client Polling System Operational**: REST endpoints for metadata and WebSocket streams for real-time position updates now working.

**Visualisation Complete**: Three.js-based 3D rendering with GPU-accelerated physics displaying agent networks intuitively.

**Full Control Interface**: Clients can now start, stop, remove and monitor agent swarms through comprehensive UI controls.

### üìö Documentation Updated

- [x] Created comprehensive IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md with complete system upgrade details
- [x] Updated README.md with new features and performance metrics
- [x] Created MIGRATION_GUIDE.md for existing deployments with step-by-step instructions
- [x] Updated architecture documentation with new system design
- [x] Created detailed WebSocket binary protocol specification
- [x] Updated main documentation index with latest changes
- [x] All documentation using UK spelling as requested
- [x] Corrected WebSocket protocol specification to include comprehensive node data

Remember: You're debugging VisionFlow's connection behaviour by examining its logs and code, but the actual VisionFlow service runs in a different container.

Keep ext/docs in sync with the changes as you work using documenting agents that write in UK spelling
