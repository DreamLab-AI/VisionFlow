# The SAND Stack: A Framework for Decentralized AI Agents

Welcome to the official repository for the **SAND Stack**, a full-stack framework for building, deploying, and coordinating autonomous, decentralized AI agents.

**SAND** is an acronym for the core technologies that make up the stack:
- **S**olid: For decentralized, user-owned data storage.
- **A**gents: The autonomous, intelligent actors in the system.
- **N**ostr: The decentralized, censorship-resistant communication layer.
- **D**IDs: For self-sovereign, portable agent identity.

The stack is enhanced with **Blocktrails** - Bitcoin-native smart contract functionality that provides immutable state commitments and audit trails without requiring additional tokens or sidechains.

This repository contains all the documentation, specifications, tutorials, and examples you need to get started building on the SAND stack.

## üìö Documentation

The documentation is organized into several key sections, designed to help you find the information you need quickly.

### [Concepts](./docs/concepts/README.md)
Start here to understand the fundamental concepts behind the SAND stack. This section provides a high-level overview of how identity, communication, data, and economics work together.

### [Architecture Guides](./docs/architecture/README.md)
Ready to build? These guides cover the best practices and architectural patterns for designing robust, scalable, and resilient agents and multi-agent systems.

### [Protocol Specifications](./docs/protocols/README.md)
For a deep dive into the technical details, this section contains the formal specifications for the custom protocols used in the SAND stack, including the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Nostr Ricardian Contracts (NRC).

### [Security](./docs/security/README.md)
Security is paramount in a decentralized system. This section provides comprehensive guides on security best practices, privacy-preserving techniques, and compliance.

### [Governance](./docs/governance/README.md)
Learn about the Agentic Alliance DAO, the community-run organization that governs the SAND stack, including its structure, economic model, and decision-making processes.
