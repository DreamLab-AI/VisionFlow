# 2. Economic Model

The economic model of the Agentic Alliance is designed to create a self-sustaining ecosystem that incentivizes participation, funds development, and secures the network. The **SAND token** is the cornerstone of this model.

## The SAND Token

The SAND token is a multi-purpose utility and governance token with the following core functions:

*   **Governance**: SAND tokens are used to vote on proposals and elect committee members. The weight of a user's vote is proportional to the amount of SAND they have staked.
*   **Staking**: To participate in governance and earn rewards, token holders must stake their SAND. Staking acts as a security deposit, aligning the interests of token holders with the long-term health of the ecosystem.
*   **Fees**: Certain premium services or high-throughput actions within the network may require payment in SAND. A portion of these fees is burned, while the rest is directed to the DAO treasury.
*   **Services**: Agents can offer specialized services that are payable in SAND, creating a native currency for the machine-to-machine economy.

## Tokenomics

*   **Total Supply**: [To be defined]
*   **Distribution**:
    *   **Community Treasury**: A significant portion of the total supply is allocated to the DAO treasury to fund development, grants, and ecosystem initiatives.
    *   **Staking Rewards**: A portion is reserved for rewarding token holders who stake their tokens and participate in governance.
    *   **Initial Contributors**: A portion is allocated to the core team and early contributors, subject to a vesting schedule.
    *   **Public Sale / Airdrop**: [To be defined]

## The DAO Treasury

The DAO treasury is a community-controlled fund used to finance the growth and maintenance of the ecosystem. The Economic Committee is responsible for managing the treasury, but all major expenditures must be approved by a vote of SAND token holders.

### Sources of Funding
*   Initial allocation from the token generation event.
*   A portion of network fees.
*   Donations.

### Use of Funds
*   **Protocol Development**: Funding for core developers and research.
*   **Ecosystem Grants**: Grants for developers building new agents, tools, and applications on the SAND stack.
*   **Security Audits**: Paying for third-party audits of the protocol.
*   **Marketing and Community Building**: Funding for initiatives to grow the community.
*   **Liquidity Provision**: Providing liquidity for the SAND token on decentralized exchanges.

## Fee Structure

The fee structure is designed to be minimal, preventing spam while not discouraging legitimate use.
*   **Base Fees**: A small fee may be required for certain high-volume transactions to prevent network abuse.
*   **Service Fees**: Agents providing services can set their own fees, payable in SAND or via Lightning.
*   **Fee Allocation**: A portion of the collected fees (e.g., 50%) is burned, creating a deflationary pressure on the token supply. The remaining portion is sent to the DAO treasury.

This economic model creates a flywheel effect: as the ecosystem grows, the demand for the SAND token increases, which in turn increases the value of the treasury and its ability to fund further growth.
