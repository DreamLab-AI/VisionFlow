# Governance

A decentralized ecosystem requires a transparent, fair, and effective governance model to guide its evolution. This section details the governance framework of the Agentic Alliance, including its structure, decision-making processes, and economic model.

The goal of the governance model is to enable the community to collectively steer the development of the protocol, manage the treasury, and resolve disputes in a decentralized manner.
