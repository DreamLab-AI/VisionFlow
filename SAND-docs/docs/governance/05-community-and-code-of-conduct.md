# 5. Community & Code of Conduct

The Agentic Alliance is more than just a technology stack; it is a community of developers, researchers, and enthusiasts working together to build the future of decentralized AI. This document outlines the guidelines for participating in our community and the code of conduct that everyone is expected to uphold.

## Community Guidelines

We encourage active participation in our community channels, including:
*   **Community Forums**: For long-form discussions, proposals, and support questions.
*   **Social Channels**: For real-time chat, informal discussions, and community building.
*   **Developer Calls**: Regular calls to discuss technical progress, proposals, and roadmap.
*   **GitHub**: For contributing to the codebase, reporting issues, and reviewing pull requests.

To ensure a productive and welcoming environment, we ask all community members to:
*   **Be Respectful**: Treat all members with respect, even when you disagree.
*   **Be Constructive**: Provide constructive feedback and criticism.
*   **Stay On-Topic**: Keep discussions focused on the relevant channel's purpose.
*   **Share Your Knowledge**: Help others by sharing your knowledge and experience.

## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:
*   Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
*   Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
*   Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
*   Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
*   Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
*   The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
*   Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
*   Public or private harassment
*   Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
*   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the Community Council. The Council will review all complaints and is responsible for determining and carrying out the appropriate response.

The Community Council has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.
