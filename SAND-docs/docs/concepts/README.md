# Core Concepts

This section introduces the foundational pillars of the Agentic Alliance and the SAND Stack. Understanding these concepts is essential for building and interacting with autonomous agents in the ecosystem.

## The SAND Stack

The ecosystem is built on a foundation of four interoperable, decentralized technologies, which we call the **SAND Stack**:

- **[S]olid**: A decentralized data storage and permissioning layer.
- **[A]gents**: The autonomous actors that are the primary citizens of the ecosystem.
- **[N]ostr**: A real-time, censorship-resistant communication and messaging layer.
- **[D]IDs**: A self-sovereign, portable identity layer that binds the stack together.

## Foundational Pillars

This section is organized into the following parts. We recommend reading them in order to build a complete picture of the ecosystem.

1.  **[Identity: The Agent's Passport](./01-identity.md)**
    *   *Learn how agents establish a self-sovereign identity using `did:nostr`.*

2.  **[Communication: The Global Message Bus](./02-communication.md)**
    *   *Explore how agents use the Nostr protocol for real-time, decentralized messaging.*

3.  **[Data & Code: The Decentralized Filesystem](./03-data-and-code.md)**
    *   *Understand the role of Solid for persistent, permissioned data storage and `ngit` for decentralized code management.*

4.  **[Economy: The Trustless Marketplace](./04-economy.md)**
    *   *Dive into the agent economy, powered by Bitcoin, HTLCs, and Nostr Ricardian Contracts.*

5.  **[Discovery & Interoperability](./05-discovery-and-interoperability.md)**
    *   *See how agents are announced, discovered, and interact with tools using open standards.*
