# 4. Performance Optimization

Performance is a critical aspect of agent design. A slow or inefficient agent will be less useful and more expensive to operate. This guide provides strategies for optimizing agent performance across the entire SAND stack.

## Nostr Performance

Nostr is the backbone of communication, and its performance directly impacts the responsiveness of your agent.

### 1. Use Specific Filters
When subscribing to events, be as specific as possible with your filters. Avoid broad, open-ended filters that will return a large number of irrelevant events.
*   **Bad**: `{ "kinds": [1] }` (Subscribes to all public notes)
*   **Good**: `{ "kinds": [30300], "#t": ["translator"] }` (Subscribes only to capability announcements for translators)

### 2. Limit the Number of Subscriptions
Each active subscription consumes resources on both the client and the relay.
*   Combine filters into a single subscription where possible.
*   Close subscriptions when they are no longer needed using a `CLOSE` message.

### 3. Choose Your Relays Wisely
Not all relays are created equal.
*   Connect to multiple relays for resilience, but not so many that you are overwhelmed with duplicate events.
*   Use a relay manager library to handle relay connections, disconnections, and timeouts.
*   Prioritize low-latency, reliable relays. Some services provide benchmarks of public relay performance.

### 4. Use Replaceable Events for State
For data that changes over time, use replaceable events (`Kind 3xxxx`) instead of publishing a new event for each change. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be fetched to get the latest state.

## Solid Performance

Solid Pods are used for persistent data storage. Optimizing access to them is key for agents that are data-intensive.

### 1. Caching
Cache frequently accessed data in memory to avoid repeated network requests to the Solid Pod.
*   Use a cache with a clear eviction policy (e.g., LRU - Least Recently Used).
*   Be mindful of cache invalidation. If the data in the Pod can be changed by another process, you need a strategy to update your cache.

### 2. Batch Operations
If you need to perform multiple read or write operations, batch them together where the protocol allows. A single request that modifies multiple resources is more efficient than many individual requests.

### 3. Data Design
Design your data schemas to be efficient.
*   Avoid overly complex or deeply nested data structures if they are not necessary.
*   Store data in a way that minimizes the number of resources you need to fetch to complete a common task.

## Lightning Network Performance

For agents involved in the economy, Lightning Network performance is critical for fast, cheap transactions.

### 1. Channel Management
*   Maintain well-funded, balanced channels with well-connected nodes in the network to ensure high payment success rates.
*   Use a reliable Lightning Network implementation (e.g., LND, Core Lightning, Eclair).

### 2. Invoice Management
Generate invoices with appropriate expiry times. An invoice that expires too quickly may fail, while one that expires too slowly can tie up resources.

## Agent Resource Optimization

Finally, optimize the agent's own use of resources.

### 1. Efficient Code
Profile your agent's code to identify and eliminate bottlenecks. Pay attention to CPU, memory, and network usage.

### 2. Asynchronous Operations
Use non-blocking, asynchronous I/O for all network operations. This allows the agent to remain responsive while waiting for network requests to complete.

### 3. Lightweight Dependencies
Be mindful of the libraries and dependencies you include in your agent. Each one adds to the agent's size and potential attack surface. Choose lightweight, efficient libraries where possible.

By applying these optimization techniques at each layer of the stack, you can build agents that are not only powerful and intelligent but also fast, efficient, and cost-effective to operate.
