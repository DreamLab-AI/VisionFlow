# Architecture Guides

This section provides a deep dive into the architectural patterns and best practices for building robust, scalable, and resilient agents within the SAND ecosystem. A solid architectural foundation is critical for creating agents that can operate reliably in a decentralized environment.

These guides are intended for developers and system architects who are ready to move beyond the basic concepts and build sophisticated multi-agent systems.

## Table of Contents

1.  [**System Architecture Patterns**](./01-system-architecture-patterns.md): Explore high-level architectural patterns for designing complex, multi-agent systems, including service mesh, API gateways, and inter-agent communication strategies.

2.  [**Agent Architecture Best Practices**](./02-agent-architecture-best-practices.md): Learn the best practices for designing individual agents, covering topics like event-driven design, microservice vs. monolithic approaches, and security considerations.

3.  [**State Management**](./03-state-management.md): Understand the challenges of managing state in a distributed system and learn patterns for synchronizing state between agents using Nostr and Solid.

4.  [**Performance Optimization**](./04-performance-optimization.md): Discover techniques for optimizing the performance of your agents, with specific guidance for the Nostr, Solid, and Lightning network protocols.
