# 2. Agent Architecture Best Practices

While system-level patterns define how agents interact, the internal architecture of each agent is equally important for building a robust and maintainable system. This guide covers best practices for designing the internals of a single agent.

## Monolithic vs. Microservice Agent

Just like in traditional software development, you can structure your agent as a single, monolithic process or as a collection of smaller, independent microservices.

### Monolithic Agent
A single process that contains all of the agent's logic.
*   **Pros**: Simple to develop, test, and deploy initially.
*   **Cons**: Can become complex and difficult to maintain as it grows. A failure in one component can bring down the entire agent.
*   **When to use**: For simple, single-purpose agents or during the initial prototyping phase.

### Microservice Agent
The agent's functionality is broken down into multiple, independent services that communicate with each other (e.g., over a local event bus or RPC).
*   **Pros**: Services can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Improved fault isolation.
*   **Cons**: More complex to set up and manage. Requires robust inter-service communication.
*   **When to use**: For complex, multi-functional agents that require high availability and scalability.

## Event-Driven Architecture

Given that the entire SAND stack is built on the event-based Nostr protocol, it is natural to adopt an **event-driven architecture** within the agent itself.

Instead of a traditional request/response model, the agent's logic is triggered by incoming events. These can be external events from the Nostr network or internal events from other components of the agent.

### Benefits
*   **Decoupling**: Components don't need direct knowledge of each other; they only need to know about the events they produce or consume.
*   **Asynchronous Operations**: The agent can remain responsive while processing tasks in the background.
*   **Scalability**: You can add more consumers to handle high event volumes.

### Implementation
A simple event bus or a more sophisticated message queue can be used internally to manage the flow of events between the agent's components.

## Horizontal Scalability

A single agent instance may not be able to handle a high volume of requests. To address this, design your agent to be **horizontally scalable**, meaning you can run multiple instances of the agent in parallel.

### Key Requirements for Scalability
*   **Statelessness**: The agent's core logic should be stateless. Any required state should be stored in an external, shared data store like a Solid Pod or a distributed cache.
*   **Idempotency**: Operations should be idempotent, meaning that processing the same event multiple times should not result in an incorrect state. This is crucial for handling message redelivery in a distributed system.
*   **Shared Subscriptions**: When multiple instances of an agent are running, they need to coordinate their Nostr subscriptions to avoid duplicate processing. This can be achieved using a shared subscription manager or by having each instance subscribe to a subset of the required filters.

## Security Best Practices

Security must be a core consideration from the beginning of the design process.
*   **Key Management**: Never store private keys directly in code. Use a secure key management solution, such as a hardware security module (HSM) or a managed secret service (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS KMS).
*   **Input Validation**: Treat all incoming data from the Nostr network as untrusted. Validate and sanitize all inputs to prevent injection attacks.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege**: The agent should only have the permissions it absolutely needs to perform its function. This applies to its Nostr key, its Solid Pod access, and any other resources it uses.

## Error Handling and Resilience

In a distributed system, failures are inevitable. Design your agent to be resilient to these failures.
*   **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Implement a circuit breaker to prevent the agent from repeatedly calling a service that is failing.
*   **Retry Logic**: Use exponential backoff for retrying failed operations to avoid overwhelming a struggling service.
*   **Dead-Letter Queue**: For events that cannot be processed after multiple retries, move them to a dead-letter queue for later analysis.
