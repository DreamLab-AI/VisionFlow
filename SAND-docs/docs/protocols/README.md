# Protocol Specifications

This section contains the detailed technical specifications for the core protocols that make up the SAND stack. These documents are the canonical reference for developers building agents, relays, and other infrastructure for the Agentic Alliance.

Adherence to these specifications is critical for ensuring interoperability across the ecosystem.

## Table of Contents

1.  [**Solid-Lite**](./01-solid-lite.md): The specification for our minimal, lightweight implementation of the Solid protocol for decentralized data storage.

2.  [**Model Context Protocol (MCP)**](./02-model-context-protocol.md): The protocol for programmatic discovery and use of agent capabilities.

3.  [**Nostr Ricardian Contracts (NRC)**](./03-nostr-ricardian-contracts.md): The specification for creating human-readable, machine-verifiable contracts on Nostr for agent-to-agent commerce.

4.  [**Protocol Integration Guide**](./04-protocol-integration-guide.md): A guide on how the different protocols in the SAND stack work together to create a cohesive system.

5.  [**Custom Extension Protocols**](./05-custom-extension-protocols.md): A list of custom Nostr event kinds and other protocol extensions used within the SAND ecosystem.

6.  [**Blocktrails**](./06-blocktrails.md): Bitcoin-native smart contract functionality for immutable state commitments and audit trails without requiring additional tokens or sidechains.
