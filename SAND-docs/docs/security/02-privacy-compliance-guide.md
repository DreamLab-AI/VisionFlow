# 2. Privacy & Compliance Guide

Privacy is not just a feature; it's a fundamental human right and a core principle of the SAND stack. Building privacy-preserving agents is essential for user trust and for complying with a growing body of data protection regulations around the world.

## Privacy by Design

Incorporate privacy considerations into every stage of the agent development lifecycle.

*   **Data Minimization**: Collect and process only the data that is absolutely necessary for the agent's function. Do not collect data just because you can.
*   **Purpose Limitation**: Be transparent about why you are collecting data and do not use it for other purposes without consent.
*   **Anonymization & Pseudonymization**: Where possible, anonymize or pseudonymize data to reduce the risk to individuals.
    *   **Pseudonymization**: Replace identifying information with a reversible, consistent token (e.g., using a user's `npub` instead of their name).
    *   **Anonymization**: Irreversibly remove identifying information. Techniques include k-anonymity, l-diversity, and t-closeness.

## Privacy-Preserving Computation (PPC)

PPC techniques allow agents to compute on data without exposing the raw data itself.

### Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC)
*   **What it is**: A cryptographic technique that allows multiple parties to jointly compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private.
*   **Use Case**: A group of agents could determine the average of their internal values without any agent revealing its own value to the others.

### Homomorphic Encryption (HE)
*   **What it is**: A form of encryption that allows computations to be performed on ciphertext. The result, when decrypted, is the same as if the computations had been performed on the plaintext.
*   **Use Case**: An agent could send encrypted data to a service provider (e.g., a "data analyst" agent) to perform a calculation. The provider could perform the analysis and return the encrypted result without ever seeing the underlying data.

### Differential Privacy
*   **What it is**: A system for publicly sharing information about a dataset by describing the patterns of groups within the dataset while withholding information about individuals. This is achieved by adding carefully calibrated "noise" to the data.
*   **Use Case**: An agent that collects statistics about user behavior could release a differentially private version of its dataset for public research without revealing the behavior of any single user.

### Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)
*   **What it is**: A method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that they know a value `x`, without conveying any information apart from the fact that they know the value `x`.
*   **Use Case**: An agent could prove to a service that it is over 18 years of age without revealing its actual birthdate.

## Regulatory Compliance (GDPR, CCPA)

Data protection regulations like the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) impose strict requirements on how personal data is handled. While the SAND stack provides tools for compliance, the responsibility ultimately lies with the agent developer.

### Key Requirements
*   **Lawful Basis for Processing**: You must have a valid legal reason to process personal data (e.g., user consent, contractual necessity).
*   **Data Subject Rights**: You must be able to fulfill user requests to access, rectify, erase, or port their data. Solid Pods are a powerful tool for this, as the user has direct control over their data.
*   **Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA)**: For high-risk data processing activities, you must conduct a DPIA to identify and mitigate privacy risks.
*   **Cross-Border Data Transfers**: If you are transferring data across jurisdictions (e.g., from the EU to the US), you must ensure you have a valid legal mechanism for doing so (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses).

By leveraging the privacy-preserving features of the SAND stack and adhering to these principles, developers can build agents that are not only powerful but also respectful of user privacy and compliant with global regulations.
