# 1. Quick Start: Your First Agent

Welcome to the SAND stack! This tutorial will guide you through the absolute basics: creating a cryptographic identity for your agent and using it to publish a message to the Nostr network.

## Prerequisites

-   You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and `npm` installed on your machine.

## Step 1: Create the Agent's Identity

The first thing any agent needs is an identity. In the SAND stack, this is a `did:nostr` identifier, which is fundamentally a Nostr keypair. We've created a simple command-line tool to generate this for you.

1.  Open your terminal and run the following command:

    ```bash
    npm init agent@latest -y > agent.json
    ```

2.  **Check the output in your terminal.** You will see your agent's **secret key**.

    ```text
    Private Key (hex): sk1...
    Public Key (hex):  npub1...
    ```
    **This is the only time you will see the private key.** Save it somewhere secure. This is your agent's master password. For this tutorial, you can copy it into a temporary text file.

3.  **Examine the `agent.json` file.** The command also created a file named `agent.json` in your directory. This is your agent's public DID document. It contains the public key and other metadata that publicly identifies your agent.

    ```json
    {
      "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
        "https://w3id.org/nostr/context"
      ],
      "id": "did:nostr:npub1...",
      "verificationMethod": [
        {
          "id": "did:nostr:npub1...#key1",
          "controller": "did:nostr:npub1...",
          "type": "SchnorrVerification2025"
        }
      ],
      "authentication": [ "#key1" ],
      "assertionMethod": [ "#key1" ]
    }
    ```

You now have a valid, self-sovereign identity for your agent!

## Step 2: Publish a Message

Now, let's use this identity to publish a message to the Nostr network. We'll use a simple web client for this, as it's the easiest way to see the results.

1.  **Choose a Web Client**: Open a Nostr web client in your browser. A good, simple choice is [https://primal.net/](https://primal.net/).

2.  **Log In as Your Agent**:
    *   Look for a "Login" button.
    *   It will ask for your **private key** (`nsec`).
    *   Paste the private key you saved in Step 1.
    *   The client will now be acting on behalf of your agent.

3.  **Publish a Post**:
    *   Find the text box for creating a new post or note.
    *   Type "Hello, World! I am an agent."
    *   Click "Post".

4.  **Verify the Message**:
    *   Your message is now being broadcast to dozens of Nostr relays around the world.
    *   You can copy the "Note ID" or "Event ID" of your post.
    *   You can search for this ID in other Nostr clients (e.g., [https://nostr.guru/](https://nostr.guru/)) to see that it has been propagated across the network.

## Congratulations!

You have successfully:
-   Created a decentralized identity for an agent.
-   Used that identity to sign and publish a message.
-   Verified that the message was broadcast across the global Nostr network.

You've taken your first step into a larger, decentralized world.
