# VisionFlow Container Rebuild - In Progress

**Date:** 2025-11-01 13:27
**Status:** Building container image with route fix
**Background Job ID:** 09346c

---

## Current Situation

### What Works âœ…
- Database has 5 test nodes
- GPU pipeline correctly implemented
- Client ready to render
- Route fix applied to source code

### What's Being Fixed ðŸ”§
- Container image rebuild with updated `admin_sync_handler.rs`
- Route configuration: `/api/admin/sync` will be accessible
- BuildKit enabled for proper multi-stage build

---

## Build Command

```bash
export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
export COMPOSE_DOCKER_CLI_BUILD=1
docker build --no-cache --target development -f Dockerfile.unified -t visionflow-dev .
```

**Estimated Time:** 10-15 minutes

---

## Next Steps (After Build Completes)

### 1. Start Container
```bash
docker run -d --name visionflow_container \
  --runtime=nvidia \
  --gpus all \
  -p 4000:4000 \
  -p 3001:3001 \
  -v visionflow-data:/app/data \
  visionflow-dev
```

### 2. Test Sync Endpoint
```bash
curl -v -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/admin/sync
# Expected: HTTP 200 + JSON response with sync statistics
```

### 3. Verify Data Flow
```bash
# Check actor loaded nodes
curl http://localhost:4000/api/graph/data | jq '.nodes | length'
# Expected: 100+ nodes from GitHub sync

# Check database
docker exec visionflow_container sh -c \
  "cd /app/data && echo 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM nodes;' | sqlite3 knowledge_graph.db"
# Expected: 100+ nodes

# Check client
open http://localhost:3001
# Expected: 3D graph visualization with nodes
```

### 4. Verify GPU Pipeline
```bash
docker logs visionflow_container | grep -i "GPU\|force\|physics"
# Expected: GPU actors computing forces, positions updating
```

---

## Monitoring Build Progress

```bash
# Check build status
docker ps -a | grep visionflow

# Monitor build output
# (Background job 09346c will complete when build finishes)

# Check image when done
docker images | grep visionflow-dev
```

---

## What This Fix Enables

Once the container rebuilds and starts:

1. **GitHub Sync** becomes accessible via `/api/admin/sync`
2. **GraphServiceActor** gets populated with nodes from logseq repository
3. **GPU Pipeline** activates automatically (physics simulation)
4. **Client** displays 3D graph with real data
5. **Complete Pipeline** verified end-to-end

---

## Root Cause Recap

The system was correctly implemented but had a single routing bug that prevented the data ingestion endpoint from being accessible. This caused the in-memory actor state to remain empty despite the database having data.

**Fix:** One-line change to route configuration in `admin_sync_handler.rs`
