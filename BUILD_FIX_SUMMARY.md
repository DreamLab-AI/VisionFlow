# Build Fix Summary

## Error Fixed
**Error**: `the trait bound SimulationParams: std::convert::From<&&settings::PhysicsSettings> is not satisfied`

**Root Cause**: 
- `get_physics()` returns `&PhysicsSettings` (a reference)
- We were doing `(&physics).into()` which created `&&PhysicsSettings` (double reference)
- The From trait is implemented for `&PhysicsSettings`, not `&&PhysicsSettings`

**Solution**:
Changed from:
```rust
let physics = settings.get_physics(graph);  // Returns &PhysicsSettings
let sim_params = (&physics).into();         // Creates &&PhysicsSettings - WRONG!
```

To:
```rust
let physics = settings.get_physics(graph);  // Returns &PhysicsSettings
let sim_params = physics.into();            // Uses &PhysicsSettings - CORRECT!
```

## Build Command
To verify the fix:
```bash
docker-compose build rust-backend
```

## Expected Result
The build should now complete successfully without the trait bound error.
