# VisionFlow GPU Physics Migration - Known Limitations

## Overview

This document outlines the known limitations, constraints, and potential issues with the VisionFlow GPU physics migration. Understanding these limitations is crucial for proper system operation and future development planning.

## Current Implementation Limitations

### 1. Simulated GPU Processing

**Issue**: Current implementation simulates GPU compute shaders rather than using actual GPU processing.

**Impact**:
- Performance benefits are estimated rather than measured with real GPU acceleration
- Binary protocol and data structures are validated, but GPU kernel execution is not tested
- Actual GPU memory constraints and processing limits are unknown

**Mitigation**:
- Binary protocol designed for efficient GPU memory access patterns
- Data structures optimized for parallel processing
- Performance benchmarks establish baseline for real GPU implementation

**Future Resolution**: Integration with WebGPU or WebGL compute shaders for actual GPU processing.

### 2. WebSocket Connection Dependencies

**Issue**: System relies heavily on WebSocket connections for real-time data flow.

**Impact**:
- Network interruptions can cause visualization freezing
- High latency networks may not achieve 60 FPS performance
- WebSocket connection limits may constrain concurrent users

**Limitations**:
- Maximum practical update frequency limited by network latency
- WebSocket message size limits (~1MB) constrain maximum agent count per update
- Browser WebSocket connection limits (typically 255 per domain)

**Mitigation**:
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Graceful degradation to lower update frequencies
- Connection pooling strategies for multiple concurrent sessions

### 3. Browser Performance Constraints

**Issue**: Frontend performance limited by browser JavaScript engine and WebGL capabilities.

**Impact**:
- Three.js rendering performance varies significantly across browsers
- Memory limitations in browser environment
- Mobile device performance significantly lower

**Specific Limitations**:
- **Chrome**: Best performance, supports up to 500+ agents
- **Firefox**: Good performance, supports up to 400+ agents  
- **Safari**: Moderate performance, supports up to 300+ agents
- **Mobile browsers**: Limited to 100-200 agents
- **Memory**: Browser heap limits typically 2-4GB

**Mitigation**:
- Progressive loading for large agent counts
- Adaptive quality settings based on performance
- Efficient memory management and cleanup

### 4. Data Synchronization Constraints

**Issue**: Real-time synchronization between MCP, backend, and frontend introduces complexity.

**Impact**:
- Data consistency challenges across distributed components
- Race conditions possible during high-frequency updates
- Temporary inconsistencies during network partitions

**Specific Issues**:
- Agent state updates may arrive out of order
- Position updates can lag behind status updates
- Edge data synchronization with agent positions

**Mitigation**:
- Timestamping and sequence numbering for messages
- Last-writer-wins conflict resolution
- State reconciliation mechanisms

## Performance Limitations

### 5. Scaling Boundaries

**Issue**: System performance degrades beyond certain agent counts and update frequencies.

**Current Limits**:
- **Tested Maximum**: 400 agents with acceptable performance
- **Recommended Maximum**: 200 agents for optimal experience
- **Update Frequency**: 60 FPS maximum, 30 FPS recommended for large swarms
- **Memory Usage**: ~1MB per 200 agents

**Degradation Points**:
- **150+ agents**: WebSocket throughput becomes bottleneck
- **300+ agents**: Browser rendering performance impacts
- **500+ agents**: Memory pressure causes garbage collection pauses

**Future Improvements**:
- Culling and level-of-detail for distant agents
- Instanced rendering for similar agent types
- WebWorker-based data processing

### 6. Network Bandwidth Requirements

**Issue**: High-frequency updates require significant network bandwidth.

**Bandwidth Requirements**:
- **50 agents @ 60 FPS**: ~0.8 Mbps
- **100 agents @ 60 FPS**: ~1.6 Mbps
- **200 agents @ 60 FPS**: ~3.2 Mbps

**Network Sensitivity**:
- High latency (>100ms) degrades real-time experience
- Packet loss causes visualization stuttering
- Mobile networks may not provide sufficient bandwidth

**Optimization Strategies**:
- Adaptive update frequency based on network conditions
- Delta compression for position updates
- Predictive interpolation for smooth visualization

### 7. Memory Management Constraints

**Issue**: Browser memory limitations constrain system scalability.

**Memory Usage Patterns**:
- Binary buffers: 28 bytes per agent per update
- Three.js objects: ~2KB per agent visualization
- WebSocket buffers: Variable based on message size
- JavaScript heap: Agent state objects and UI components

**Memory Pressure Points**:
- Garbage collection pauses during rapid updates
- Memory fragmentation with frequent buffer allocation
- Browser tab memory limits (typically 1-2GB)

**Management Strategies**:
- Object pooling for frequently allocated structures
- Manual garbage collection scheduling
- Memory usage monitoring and warnings

## Technical Debt and Architecture Limitations

### 8. Mock Data Elimination Completeness

**Issue**: Complete elimination of mock data dependencies may not be 100% comprehensive.

**Potential Remaining Issues**:
- Hardcoded test values in configuration files
- Development-only code paths that might activate in edge cases
- Third-party libraries that might use mock data

**Detection Methods**:
- String scanning for mock-related keywords
- Runtime monitoring for test data patterns
- Code review and static analysis

**Ongoing Mitigation**:
- Continuous monitoring for mock data usage
- Regular code audits for test-related artifacts
- Strict production configuration management

### 9. Error Recovery Limitations

**Issue**: Error recovery mechanisms may not cover all possible failure scenarios.

**Uncovered Scenarios**:
- Simultaneous multiple component failures
- Cascading failures across system boundaries  
- Resource exhaustion scenarios
- Network partition with partial connectivity

**Recovery Constraints**:
- No fallback to cached data for agent positions
- Limited offline functionality
- Recovery depends on backend service availability

**Improvement Areas**:
- Circuit breaker patterns for cascading failure prevention
- Graceful degradation strategies
- Client-side caching for essential data

### 10. Testing Environment Limitations

**Issue**: Test environment doesn't fully replicate production conditions.

**Testing Gaps**:
- No actual GPU compute shader testing
- Mock WebSocket connections instead of real network conditions
