## 🚀 How to Use

### Quick Start (3 steps)

```bash
# 1. Start Vircadia server
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.vircadia.yml --profile dev up -d

# 2. Open VisionFlow
open http://localhost:3001

# 3. Enable Multi-User Mode
# Settings → Multi-User XR → Toggle ON → Click "Connect"
```

### Verify It Works

1. **Check Docker:**
   ```bash
   docker ps | grep vircadia-world-server
   # Should show: vircadia-world-server (healthy)
   ```

2. **Check Connection:**
   - Open VisionFlow Settings
   - Navigate to "Multi-User XR"
   - Status should show: 🟢 Connected
   - Agent ID and Session ID should be populated

3. **Test Multi-User:**
   - Open VisionFlow in two browser windows
   - Enable Multi-User in both
   - Both should appear in "Active Users" list

## 🎯 What's Next

### Recommended Enhancements

1. **WebRTC Voice Integration** (from voice-webrtc-migration-plan.md)
   - Migrate VoiceWebSocketService to WebRTC
   - Integrate with SpatialAudioManager
   - Timeline: 6 weeks

2. **Avatar Customization**
   - Add avatar model selection
   - Custom colors and shapes
   - Username display customization

3. **Advanced Collaboration**
   - Shared camera views ("Follow me" mode)
   - Drawing/markup tools
   - Chat system integration

4. **Performance Optimizations**
   - LOD (level-of-detail) for distant entities
   - Interest management (only sync nearby)
   - Differential updates (send only changes)

5. **Security Hardening**
   - TLS/WSS encryption
   - JWT token authentication
   - Rate limiting
   - Access control per world

### Optional Integrations

- **Vircadia Marketplace:** Load pre-built worlds

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Vircadia Docker Image:**
   - Used `ghcr.io/vircadia/vircadia-world-server:latest` as placeholder
   - Actual image may need adjustment based on Vircadia release
   - May need to build custom image if official unavailable

2. **Testing Framework Disabled:**
   - Automated tests not run due to security concerns (see task.md)
   - Manual testing required until test framework re-enabled

3. **Avatar Models:**
   - Simple geometric avatars (cubes/spheres)
   - Advanced 3D models require asset loading

4. **Voice System:**
   - Currently uses VoiceWebSocketService (legacy)
   - Needs WebRTC migration for optimal performance (see plan)
