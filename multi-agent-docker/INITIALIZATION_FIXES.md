# Docker Initialization Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the improvements made to ensure reliable startup and operation of the Multi-Agent Docker environment.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. MCP Services Not Starting
**Problem**: Supervisor was trying to run `npm run` commands from `/workspace` where no `package.json` existed.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `supervisord.conf` to use direct `node` commands instead of npm scripts
- Added proper working directory and environment variables
- Included authentication tokens in environment

### 2. Missing Prerequisites on First Start
**Problem**: Required directories and configurations weren't created before services started.

**Solution** in `entrypoint.sh`:
- Create all required directories (`/workspace/.swarm`, `/app/mcp-logs`, etc.)
- Set up Rust toolchain default if not configured
- Ensure claude-flow is globally available
- Run setup script automatically on first start
- Copy MCP scripts to workspace if missing

### 3. Health Check Issues
**Problem**: Basic health check only tested if ports responded, not actual service health.

**Solution**:
- Created comprehensive `health-check.sh` script that verifies:
  - TCP server health endpoint
  - Port connectivity
  - WebSocket bridge status
  - Supervisor service status
  - Critical directories
  - Recent error logs
- Updated docker-compose to use the new health check
- Increased start_period to 90s for proper initialization

### 4. Service Startup Verification
**Problem**: Services might fail to start but container would still report as healthy.

**Solution** in `setup-workspace.sh`:
- Added `verify_services_startup()` function that:
  - Attempts supervisor restart
  - Falls back to manual process start if needed
  - Waits for health endpoint to respond
  - Runs health check script after startup

### 5. Claude Code Authentication
**Problem**: Manual authentication required inside each container.

**Solution**:
- Read credentials from `.env` file
- Automatically create `.claude/.credentials.json` on container start
- Support both `/home/dev` and `/home/ubuntu` paths
- Provide `update-claude-auth` script for credential updates
- Calculate proper expiry time (30 days)

## Configuration Changes

### Updated Files

1. **`supervisord.conf`**
   - Direct node commands instead of npm scripts
   - Added working directory
   - Included auth environment variables

2. **`entrypoint.sh`**
   - Create required directories
   - Set up Rust toolchain
   - Configure Claude authentication
   - Run setup on first start
   - Verify script availability

3. **`setup-workspace.sh`**
   - Added service startup verification
   - Improved error handling
   - Better status reporting

4. **`docker-compose.yml`**
   - Pass Claude credentials as environment variables
   - Use improved health check script
   - Increased health check start period

5. **New Scripts**
   - `health-check.sh` - Comprehensive health verification
   - `update-claude-auth.sh` - Update Claude credentials
   - `docs/claude-auth.md` - Authentication documentation

## Usage

### Initial Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Add your Claude credentials:
   ```
   CLAUDE_CODE_ACCESS=sk-ant-oat01-your-token
   CLAUDE_CODE_REFRESH=sk-ant-ort01-your-refresh
   ```
3. Build and start: `docker compose up -d multi-agent`

### Verify Health

```bash
# Check container health
docker ps

# Run health check manually
docker exec multi-agent-container /app/core-assets/scripts/health-check.sh

# Check specific services
docker exec multi-agent-container mcp-tcp-status
docker exec multi-agent-container mcp-ws-status
```

### Update Credentials

```bash
# Inside container
update-claude-auth

# Or from outside
docker exec -it multi-agent-container update-claude-auth "new-access" "new-refresh"
```

## Monitoring

The improved system provides multiple ways to monitor health:

1. **Docker health check**: Runs automatically every 30s
2. **Health endpoint**: `http://localhost:9501/health`
3. **Manual check**: `mcp-health` alias inside container
4. **Logs**: Check `/app/mcp-logs/` for service logs

## Rollback

If issues occur, you can rollback by:
1. Restore original files from git
2. Remove the `.setup_completed` marker: `rm workspace/.setup_completed`
3. Rebuild: `docker compose build multi-agent`
