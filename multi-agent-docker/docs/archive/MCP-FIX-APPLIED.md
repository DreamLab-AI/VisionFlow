# ✅ MCP Configuration Fix Applied

**Status**: Ready for testing
**Time**: 2025-10-05 17:08

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Problem: NPX Cache Corruption
- NPM's npx cache was corrupted: `ENOTEMPTY` errors
- `npx claude-flow@latest` was failing
- Claude Code couldn't start the MCP server

### Solution: Use Global Installation
Changed from:
```json
{
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["--yes", "claude-flow@latest", "mcp", "start"]
}
```

To:
```json
{
  "command": "/usr/sbin/claude-flow",
  "args": ["mcp", "start"],
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_FLOW_DB_PATH": "/workspace/.swarm/claude-local.db"
  }
}
```

### Actions Taken
1. ✅ Cleaned NPM cache completely
2. ✅ Updated `/home/dev/.mcp.json` to use global claude-flow
3. ✅ Verified global claude-flow works: `v2.0.0`
4. ✅ Database isolation configured
5. ✅ Updated configure script for future use

## 🧪 Test Now in Claude Code

**In your terminal where Claude is running:**

```
/mcp
# Select option for claude-flow
# Choose: Reconnect
```

## 📊 Expected Results

### ✅ Success
- MCP status shows "connected"
- File created: `/workspace/.swarm/claude-local.db`
- Container stays running
- Can use claude-flow tools

### Verify After Connection
```bash
# Check DB was created
docker exec multi-agent-container ls -la /workspace/.swarm/*.db

# Check container still running
docker ps --filter "name=multi-agent-container"

# Check no SQLite lock errors
docker logs multi-agent-container 2>&1 | grep -i "lock\|database"
```

## 🔍 Current MCP Server Status

From your screenshot:
- ❌ agentic-payments - failed
- ❌ claude-flow - failed (should work after reconnect)
- ❌ flow-nexus - failed
- ✅ playwright - connected
- ❌ ruv-swarm - failed

**Focus on claude-flow first** - that's the critical one for database isolation testing.

## 📝 Other Failed Servers

If you want to fix the others too:

### agentic-payments
Likely needs: `npm install -g agentic-payments`

### flow-nexus
Likely needs: `npm install -g flow-nexus`

### ruv-swarm
Check: `/home/dev/.mcp.json` for correct config

But **test claude-flow first** - that's the one we've been fixing!

## 🎯 The Critical Test

This tests the original issue:
> "container completely exits when connecting claude-flow MCP"

With our fixes:
- ✅ Database isolation: `/workspace/.swarm/claude-local.db`
- ✅ Global binary: No NPX corruption
- ✅ Cache cleaned: Fresh start
- ✅ Container healthy: `init: true` prevents exit

**Try reconnecting now!**
