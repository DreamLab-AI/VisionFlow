## üõ†Ô∏è Common Tasks

### Check Service Status
```bash
mcp-status          # All MCP services
cf-tcp-status       # Claude-Flow TCP
playwright-proxy-status  # Playwright proxy
```

### View Logs
```bash
mcp-tcp-logs        # MCP TCP server
cf-logs             # Claude-Flow logs
playwright-proxy-logs  # Playwright proxy
```

### Test Connections
```bash
playwright-stack-test  # Test Playwright stack
cf-test-tcp         # Test Claude-Flow TCP
mcp-test-health     # Test MCP health
```

## üêõ Quick Troubleshooting

- **Services not starting?** Run `mcp-restart`
- **Can't connect to GUI tools?** Check with `docker-compose ps gui-tools-service`
- **Authentication issues?** See [Claude Authentication](features/01-claude-authentication.md)
- **Browser automation failing?** Run `playwright-stack-test`

## üìû Support

- Check [Troubleshooting Guide](reference/04-troubleshooting.md)
- Review logs with the commands above
- Ensure both containers are running: `docker-compose ps`
