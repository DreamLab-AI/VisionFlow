# Minimal version without Playwright if build fails
# Use the main Dockerfile but comment out Playwright sections

# To use this instead:
# 1. In docker-compose.yml, change:
#    dockerfile: Dockerfile.minimal
# 2. Playwright will not be available in GUI container
# 3. You can still use other GUI tools (Blender, QGIS, etc.)

# Copy the main Dockerfile and comment out lines 117-132 (Playwright section)
