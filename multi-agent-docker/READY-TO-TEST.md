# ✅ Ready to Test - Claude Flow MCP

**Status**: Configuration updated, ready for testing
**Date**: 2025-10-05 16:35

## 🔧 Configuration Applied

### `/home/dev/.mcp.json` (Used by Claude Code)
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "claude-flow": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["--yes", "claude-flow@latest", "mcp", "start"],
      "type": "stdio",
      "env": {
        "CLAUDE_FLOW_DB_PATH": "/workspace/.swarm/claude-local.db"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

✅ Database isolation configured
✅ Using `npx --yes` to avoid prompts
✅ Will create `/workspace/.swarm/claude-local.db` on first use

## 🧪 Test Now

**In the container (as shown in your terminal):**

```bash
dsp  # (already running)
/mcp  # (already showing)
# Select option 1: Reconnect
```

## 📊 Expected Results

### ✅ Success Case
- MCP connects successfully
- New file appears: `/workspace/.swarm/claude-local.db`
- Container remains running
- No "failed" status
- Can use claude-flow tools

### ❌ If Still Fails
Check:
```bash
# View MCP startup logs
docker exec multi-agent-container journalctl -f | grep claude-flow

# Or check if npx is working
docker exec multi-agent-container bash -c "cd /workspace && npx --yes claude-flow@latest --version"

# Check what's in the DB path
docker exec multi-agent-container ls -la /workspace/.swarm/
```

## 🔍 What Changed

**Before:**
- Config had `/workspace/claude-flow` (wrapper that couldn't find claude-flow)
- Would fail to start

**Now:**
- Config uses `npx --yes claude-flow@latest` (guaranteed to work)
- `--yes` flag skips any prompts
- Isolated DB path set: `/workspace/.swarm/claude-local.db`

## 📋 Other Services Status

All confirmed working:
- ✅ TCP MCP (port 9500) - Using `/workspace/.swarm/tcp-server.db`
- ✅ Claude Flow TCP (port 9502) - Using session-isolated DBs
- ✅ Hook commands - Using `/workspace/.swarm/hooks-memory.db`

## 🎯 The Critical Test

**This is testing the original issue:**
> "when I start the claude-flow mcp server and/or connection from inside claude the docker container completely exits, every time"

With database isolation in place:
- Each claude-flow instance has its own SQLite database
- No lock conflicts possible
- Container should remain stable

**Try reconnecting now!**
