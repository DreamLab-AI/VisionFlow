# VisionFlow TODO Status - COMPLETED âœ…
*Last Updated: January 2025*

## ðŸŽ‰ ALL CRITICAL TASKS COMPLETED

This document has been updated to reflect the completion of all priority tasks. All critical issues have been resolved and the system is fully functional.

## Priority 1: Critical - Fix Broken Physics and Settings UI âœ… COMPLETED
**Status: âœ… ALL TASKS COMPLETED (January 2025)**

These tasks were critical as they addressed a fundamental bug that made the physics engine and its UI controls completely non-functional.

### âœ… COMPLETED: Resolve Settings Store Conflict
**Completion Date: January 2025**
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Delete the broken stub store file located at /ext/client/src/features/settings/store/settingsStore.ts.
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Perform a global search for from '@/features/settings/store/settingsStore' and replace all (approximately 53) incorrect import paths to point to the one correct, working store: from '@/store/settingsStore'.
- âœ… **VERIFIED**: All components now use the correct settings store
Reference: CODEBASE_PARTIAL_REFACTORS_ANALYSIS.md, SETTINGS_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md, SETTINGS_GUIDE.md.
### âœ… COMPLETED: Re-enable Physics Controls
**Completion Date: January 2025**
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: In the file /ext/client/src/features/physics/components/PhysicsEngineControls.tsx, remove the hardcoded const settings = null; and the stub const updatePhysics = async (update: any) => {};.
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Connect the component to the now-correctly-imported useSettingsStore hook to read settings and call the updateSettings (or updatePhysics) function.
- âœ… **VERIFIED**: Physics controls now functional and responsive
Reference: CODEBASE_PARTIAL_REFACTORS_ANALYSIS.md, SETTINGS_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md.
### âœ… COMPLETED: Verify Full Physics Parameter Flow
**Completion Date: January 2025**
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Confirm that changes made in the UI's physics controls are successfully sent to the backend via the POST /api/settings REST endpoint.
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Verify the backend correctly propagates these settings from PhysicsSettings -> SimulationParams -> SimParams and finally to the GPUComputeActor and the unified CUDA kernel.
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Test the physics simulation to ensure it is stable, responds to UI changes, and that the fixes for nodes collapsing and incorrect GPU initialization are working as intended.
- âœ… **VERIFIED**: Full end-to-end data flow from UI to GPU kernel confirmed working
Reference: PHYSICS_PARAMETERS_FIX.md, CORRECTED_SETTINGS_GPU_FLOW.md, NODE_COLLAPSE_FIX.md.
## Priority 2: High - Fix Core Architecture and Complete Stubs âœ… COMPLETED
**Status: âœ… ALL TASKS COMPLETED (January 2025)**

These tasks fixed major architectural flaws and completed key features that were disabled or incomplete.

### âœ… COMPLETED: Correct Frontend MCP Architecture
**Completion Date: January 2025**
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Remove all direct MCP WebSocket connection logic from the frontend, as it is architecturally incorrect.
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Delete the service file /client/src/features/bots/services/MCPWebSocketService.ts.
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Refactor BotsVisualization.tsx and related components to fetch agent metadata exclusively through the /api/bots/* REST endpoints. The frontend should not connect to MCP.
- âœ… **VERIFIED**: Frontend now uses REST-only architecture as designed
Reference: frontend-mcp-issue.md, mcp-integration.md.
### âœ… COMPLETED: Correct Backend MCP/Agent Connection
**Completion Date: January 2025**
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Ensure the backend's EnhancedClaudeFlowActor connects to the Claude Flow service (powerdev or multi-agent-container) exclusively via WebSocket, as specified in the corrected architecture documents. Disable and remove any fallback stdio or TCP logic.
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Fix and re-enable the BotsClient connection mentioned as "DISABLED" in main.rs. Ensure it uses the correct WebSocket protocol to communicate with the EnhancedClaudeFlowActor and the MCP service.
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Remove the mock data generation for agents and switch to using live data from the now-functional MCP connection.
- âœ… **VERIFIED**: Backend MCP connection working via WebSocket
Reference: mcp_connection.md, claude-flow-actor.md, CODEBASE_PARTIAL_REFACTORS_ANALYSIS.md.
### âœ… COMPLETED: Complete Backend Service Stubs
**Completion Date: January 2025**
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: In agent_visualization_processor.rs, implement the //TODOs to fetch real CPU/memory usage from system metrics and other agent data from the MCP connection.
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: In speech_service.rs, implement the OpenAI provider for Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text.
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: In health_handler.rs, replace placeholder status checks with actual diagnostics for core services (GPU, MCP connection, Database, etc.).
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: In edge_generation.rs, replace placeholder indices with logic to generate edges based on actual graph data relationships.
- âœ… **VERIFIED**: All backend services now have complete implementations
Reference: CODEBASE_PARTIAL_REFACTORS_ANALYSIS.md.
## Priority 3: Medium - Refactoring and Code Cleanup âœ… COMPLETED
**Status: âœ… ALL TASKS COMPLETED (January 2025)**

These tasks improved code health, maintainability, and performance by removing obsolete code.

### âœ… COMPLETED: Finalize CUDA Kernel Consolidation
**Completion Date: January 2025**
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Delete all legacy CUDA kernel (.cu) and compiled PTX (.ptx) files, keeping only the single unified kernel: visionflow_unified.cu and its compiled PTX.
- âœ… **VERIFIED**: Only unified kernel remains, 89% code reduction achieved
Reference: CUDA_CONSOLIDATION_COMPLETE.md, UNIFIED_CUDA_COMPLETION.md.
### âœ… COMPLETED: Remove Deprecated Rust Modules
**Completion Date: January 2025**
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Delete the entire deprecated advanced_gpu_compute.rs module.
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Refactor any remaining code that references it to use unified_gpu_compute.rs exclusively.
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Ensure the Array of Structures (AoS) to Structure of Arrays (SoA) data conversion is handled correctly by the unified module, permanently resolving the issue from KERNEL_PARAMETER_FIX.md.
- âœ… **VERIFIED**: Clean module architecture with unified GPU compute only
Reference: CODEBASE_PARTIAL_REFACTORS_ANALYSIS.md, UNIFIED_KERNEL_MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md.
### âœ… COMPLETED: Clean Up Legacy Settings Code
**Completion Date: January 2025**
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Once the settings system is confirmed stable, remove the legacy flat-field migration code from /src/config/mod.rs and any backward-compatibility layers in the frontend's settingsStore.ts.
- âœ… **VERIFIED**: Settings system stable with all legacy code removed
Reference: CODEBASE_PARTIAL_REFACTORS_ANALYSIS.md.
