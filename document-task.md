Based on the analysis of the file tree and the content of the provided markdown files, here is a list of stubs, development notes, and redundant files that can be deleted to clean up the documentation.

### 1. Files That Can Be Deleted Immediately

These files are development notes, temporary reports, fix summaries, redundant indexes, or auto-generated meta-files that are no longer necessary and can be safely removed without losing critical information.

-   **`AGENT_VISUALIZATION_FIX_SUMMARY.md`**: A summary of a past bug fix. The architectural outcome should be captured in the main architecture documents.
-   **`comprehensive-fixes-summary.md`**: A summary report of a batch of fixes.
-   **`constraint_integration_summary.md`**: A summary of a feature integration.
-   **`dead-code-fixes-summary.md`**: A summary of a code cleanup task.
-   **`DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md`**: A large, auto-generated index that is difficult to maintain and is redundant with the file system structure and any navigation generated by a documentation tool.
-   **`GPU_PHYSICS_FIX.md`**: A summary of a specific GPU-related bug fix.
-   **`MARKDOWN_INVENTORY.json`**: A JSON file containing a snapshot inventory of markdown files.
-   **`performance_analysis_report.md`**: A development report.
-   **`phase1-implementation-plan.md`**: A development plan, which is now historical.
-   **`phase1-implementation-roadmap.md`**: A development roadmap, which is now historical.
-   **`ptx_verification_report.md`**: A technical verification report.
-   **`README.md`** (in `docs/`): A meta-navigation file that is redundant. The `docs/index.md` serves as the main entry point.
-   **`SETTINGS_FLOW_TRACE.md`**: A specific debugging trace for a past issue.
-   **`SITEMAP.md`**: A file-tree representation of the documentation, which is redundant and hard to maintain.
-   **`test-strategy-comprehensive.md`**: A planning document for testing strategy.
-   **`test-strategy-summary.md`**: A summary of the testing strategy.
-   **`testing/index.md`**: A stub index file containing only one link.
-   **`voice-integration-final-status.md`**: A development status report.
-   **`voice-to-swarm-complete-summary.md`**: A summary of a feature implementation.
-   **`voice-to-swarm-implementation-summary.md`**: A summary of a feature implementation.
-   **`voice-to-swarm-integration-plan.md`**: A planning document for a feature.
-   **All `README.md` files that serve only as indexes for their directories**:
    -   `architecture/README.md`
    -   `guides/README.md`
    -   `reference/README.md`
    -   `reference/agents/README.md`
    -   `reference/agents/consensus/README.md`
    -   `reference/agents/optimization/README.md`
    -   `reference/agents/swarm/README.md`
    -   `technical/README.md`

### 2. Files to Delete After Migration or Consolidation

These files contain valuable information but are either redundant, misplaced, or should be part of a more comprehensive document. They can be deleted after the specified information has been migrated.

#### **`AGENT_TYPE_CONVENTIONS.md`**
-   **Action**: Move this file. It contains critical, non-ephemeral information about agent design.
-   **Migration**:
    -   **What to migrate**: The entire file content.
    -   **Where to migrate**: Move the file to `docs/reference/agents/agent-conventions.md`. This places it logically within the agent reference materials.

#### **`agent-visualization-architecture.md`**
-   **Action**: Move this file. It is a core architecture document located in the wrong place.
-   **Migration**:
    -   **What to migrate**: The entire file content.
    -   **Where to migrate**: Move the file to `docs/architecture/agent-visualization.md`.

#### **`analysis_report.json`**
-   **Action**: Delete this file. It is a large JSON report that is not part of the user-facing documentation.
-   **Migration**:
    -   **What to migrate**: No migration needed. This is a development artifact.
    -   **Where to migrate**: N/A.

#### **`binary-protocol.md`**
-   **Action**: Move this file. It is a technical specification.
-   **Migration**:
    -   **What to migrate**: The entire file content.
    -   **Where to migrate**: Move the file to `docs/api/binary-protocol.md` to group it with other API and protocol specifications.

#### **`CONFIGURATION.md`** and **`getting-started/configuration.md`**
-   **Action**: Consolidate and delete. There are three separate, large configuration guides, which creates confusion. `docs/configuration/index.md` is the most comprehensive and should be the single source of truth.
-   **Migration**:
    -   **What to migrate**: Review `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` and `docs/getting-started/configuration.md`. Identify any unique sections or parameters not present in `docs/configuration/index.md` and merge them into it.
    -   **Where to migrate**: All valuable, unique information should be merged into `docs/configuration/index.md`.
    -   **After Migration**: Delete `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` and `docs/getting-started/configuration.md`.

#### **`cuda-parameters.md`**
-   **Action**: Move this file. It is a reference document.
-   **Migration**:
    -   **What to migrate**: The entire file content.
    -   **Where to migrate**: Move the file to `docs/reference/cuda-parameters.md`.

#### **`getting-started.md`**
-   **Action**: Delete this file. It is redundant with the `docs/getting-started/` directory, which has its own `index.md`.
-   **Migration**:
    -   **What to migrate**: Ensure any unique introductory content is present in `docs/getting-started/index.md`.
    -   **Where to migrate**: Merge any missing overview content into `docs/getting-started/index.md`.

#### **`gpu-analytics-api.md`**
-   **Action**: Consolidate and delete. This document describes API endpoints that belong with other analytics endpoints.
-   **Migration**:
    -   **What to migrate**: The content describing the GPU analytics endpoints (`/params`, `/gpu-metrics`, `/gpu-status`, etc.).
    -   **Where to migrate**: Merge this information into `docs/api/analytics-endpoints.md`.

#### **`mcp-agent-telemetry.md`**
-   **Action**: Consolidate and delete. This appears to be a design document or component-specific documentation for an "Observability Server".
-   **Migration**:
    -   **What to migrate**: The list of available tools and the description of the spring physics configuration.
    -   **Where to migrate**: This information should be integrated into `docs/features/agent-orchestration.md` or a relevant architecture document like `docs/architecture/mcp-integration.md`.

#### **`multi-mcp-agent-visualization.md`**
-   **Action**: Move this file. It is a core architecture document.
-   **Migration**:
    -   **What to migrate**: The entire file content.
    -   **Where to migrate**: Move the file to `docs/architecture/multi-mcp-visualization.md`. It should be linked from `agent-visualization.md`.

#### **`ptx-architecture.md`**
-   **Action**: Move this file. It is a core architecture document.
-   **Migration**:
    -   **What to migrate**: The entire file content.
    -   **Where to migrate**: Move the file to `docs/architecture/ptx-architecture.md`.

#### **`voice-system.md`**
-   **Action**: Move this file. It is a core feature/architecture document.
-   **Migration**:
    -   **What to migrate**: The entire file content.
    -   **Where to migrate**: Move the file to `docs/architecture/voice-system.md`.
