# VisionFlow Visualization Status

## ✅ Services Running
- **Nginx**: Port 3001 (main entry point)
- **Vite Dev Server**: Port 5173 (frontend)
- **Rust Backend**: Port 4000 (API)

## 🎯 Current Status

### Fixed Issues:
1. ✅ All services running via supervisord
2. ✅ API responding with graph data
3. ✅ Frontend loading at http://192.168.0.51:3001
4. ✅ Mock API fallback implemented

### Swarm Visualization Implementation:
1. ✅ SwarmVisualization component already exists with:
   - Gold and green color scheme
   - Force-directed graph physics
   - Node shapes based on agent status
   - Edge animations for communication
   - "Living Hive" particle effects

2. ✅ Component integrated into GraphCanvas

3. ⚠️ WebSocket URL updated to ws://host:3000/ws (as per task.md)

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Verify MCP Server Connection**
   - The SwarmVisualization expects to connect to ws://host:3000/ws
   - Need to ensure claude-flow MCP server is running on port 3000

2. **Test Visualization**
   - Open browser console at http://192.168.0.51:3001
   - Check for WebSocket connection attempts
   - Monitor for any JavaScript errors

3. **Debug Connection Issues**
   - If WebSocket fails, the component shows error message
   - Check if MCP orchestrator is running in multi-agent-docker

## 📊 Visual Design Implemented

Per task.md requirements:
- **Nodes**: Agent representation
  - Color by type (gold/green palette)
  - Size by workload/CPU usage
  - Shape by status (sphere/tetrahedron/box)
  - Health border indicator
  - Pulse animation for activity

- **Edges**: Communication flow
  - Animated particles showing direction
  - Thickness by data volume
  - Speed by message frequency

- **Physics**: Force-directed layout
  - Link strength by communication volume
  - Node gravity by token usage
  - Repulsion for unhealthy agents

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. CSS import order warnings (fixed)
2. MCP WebSocket server may not be running on expected port
3. Need to verify docker network connectivity between containers
