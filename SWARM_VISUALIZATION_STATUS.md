# Swarm Visualization Implementation Status

## üéØ Objective Achieved

The VisionFlow application now has an integrated swarm visualization that:
1. Renders alongside the existing knowledge graph in the same 3D space
2. Uses the gold and green color scheme as specified in task.md
3. Attempts to connect to the MCP server for live agent data
4. Falls back to mock data when MCP server is unavailable

## üîß Implementation Details

### Components Created/Modified:

1. **SwarmVisualizationIntegrated** (`/client/src/features/swarm/components/SwarmVisualizationIntegrated.tsx`)
   - Main visualization component using React Three Fiber
   - Integrates with existing rendering pipeline
   - Gold and green color palette matching requirements
   - Handles both MCP data and fallback scenarios

2. **MCPWebSocketService** (`/client/src/features/swarm/services/MCPWebSocketService.ts`)
   - WebSocket client for MCP server connection
   - Tries multiple possible container hostnames
   - Implements JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol for MCP tools
   - Methods for fetching agents, token usage, and communications

3. **API Service Updates** (`/client/src/services/api.ts`)
   - Added mock swarm data fallback
   - Provides demonstration data when MCP/backend unavailable

4. **GraphCanvas Integration** (`/client/src/features/graph/components/GraphCanvas.tsx`)
   - Updated to render SwarmVisualizationIntegrated
   - Both graphs render in the same 3D space

## üé® Visual Features Implemented

### Nodes (Agents):
- **Color**: Based on agent type using gold/green palette
- **Size**: Proportional to workload/activity
- **Shape**: Spheres (can vary by status)
- **Animation**: Metallic sheen and emissive glow
- **Health**: Would show in border color when live data available

### Edges (Communications):
- **Color**: Green (#2ECC71) for data flow
- **Thickness**: Based on data volume
- **Opacity**: Based on message frequency

### Status Display:
- Shows agent count, communication count, and connection status
- Gold border (#F1C40F) for the status panel
- "üêù Agent Swarm" header

## üîå Connection Approach

The implementation tries to connect to the MCP server in this order:
1. `ws://claude-flow:3000/ws` (container name)
2. `ws://claude-flow.docker_ragflow:3000/ws` (with network)
3. `ws://host.docker.internal:3000/ws` (from host)
4. `ws://localhost:3000/ws` (fallback)
5. Other Docker network variations

When MCP connection fails, it falls back to:
- Backend API endpoint `/api/swarm/data` (if implemented)
- Mock data with 8 demonstration agents

## üöÄ Current State

The swarm visualization is now:
- ‚úÖ Rendering in the same space as the knowledge graph
- ‚úÖ Using the correct gold/green color scheme
- ‚úÖ Attempting to connect to live MCP data
- ‚úÖ Providing mock visualization when live data unavailable
- ‚úÖ Following the same physics/rendering system as main graph

## üìù Next Steps for Full Integration

To get live data flowing:

1. **Ensure MCP Server is Running**:
   - The claude-flow container must be running with MCP server on port 3000
   - Container must be accessible on the docker_ragflow network

2. **Network Configuration**:
   - Verify container names and network connectivity
   - May need to add explicit container links or aliases

3. **Backend Integration** (Optional):
   - Add `/api/swarm/data` endpoint in Rust backend
   - Proxy MCP data through backend for better reliability
   - Apply same physics processing as knowledge graph

## üîç Debugging Tips

Check browser console for:
- "Attempting to connect to MCP server..."
- "MCP connection failed, falling back to backend API"
- "Loaded swarm data from backend: X agents"

The visualization will show connection status in the UI panel.

## ‚ú® Result

You should now see:
- Two force-directed graphs side by side
- Knowledge graph in its original colors
- Swarm visualization in gold/green to the right
- Status panel showing swarm information
- Mock agents demonstrating the visualization capabilities

The system is ready to display live agent data as soon as the MCP server connection is established!
