Based on a thorough analysis of the provided file tree and code, I have identified several instances of dead and duplicated code. These suggest areas of the codebase that have been refactored or abandoned, leaving behind unused or redundant files.

### Duplicated Code

The following files or code blocks have overlapping or identical functionality, indicating that one version is likely obsolete.

1.  **`ErrorBoundary` Component**
    *   **Location 1:** `client/src/app/App.tsx` (as an inner class)
    *   **Location 2:** `client/src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` (as a standalone component)
    *   **Analysis:** The `App.tsx` file contains a basic, non-reusable `ErrorBoundary` class. The standalone `ErrorBoundary.tsx` is more feature-rich, reusable, and follows best practices. The inner class in `App.tsx` is redundant.

2.  **Settings Batch Update API**
    *   **Location 1:** `client/src/api/batchUpdateApi.ts` (function `updateSettings`)
    *   **Location 2:** `client/src/api/settingsApi.ts` (function `updateSettingsByPaths`)
    *   **Analysis:** Both files provide a function to batch-update settings. The implementation in `settingsApi.ts` is significantly more advanced, featuring debouncing, prioritization, and retry logic. The `updateSettings` function and the associated `useBatchUpdates` hook in `batchUpdateApi.ts` are duplicated and obsolete.

3.  **Hologram Effect Components**
    *   **Location 1:** `client/src/features/visualisation/components/HologramEnvironment.tsx`
    *   **Location 2:** `client/src/features/visualisation/components/WorldClassHologram.tsx`
    *   **Location 3:** `client/src/features/visualisation/components/HologramMotes.tsx`
    *   **Analysis:** `HologramEnvironment.tsx` is the component used in the main `GraphCanvas.tsx`. It consolidates functionality and contains its own implementations of `HolographicRing`, `MotesRing`, and `EnergyFieldParticles`. The other two files, `WorldClassHologram.tsx` and `HologramMotes.tsx`, contain nearly identical, duplicated implementations of these same effects and are not used by the application.

4.  **Logging System Implementations**
    *   **Location 1:** `client/src/utils/logger.ts` (simple, static logger)
    *   **Location 2:** `client/src/utils/loggerConfig.ts` (dynamic logger that respects `clientDebugState`)
    *   **Location 3:** A complex system across multiple files: `dynamicLogger.ts`, `dynamicLoggerConfig.ts`, `loggerRegistry.ts`, `loggerProvider.ts`, `loggerDebugBridge.ts`, `loggerInit.ts`, `loggerIntegrationInit.ts`, `console.ts`.
    *   **Analysis:** There are at least two distinct and active logger implementations (`logger.ts` and `loggerConfig.ts`) being used throughout the app, which is a source of inconsistency. The third, highly complex system (Location 3) appears to be an unused experiment, as it is only referenced in its own test and example files. This entire complex system is effectively dead code, and the project should standardize on a single one of the other two implementations.

5.  **SSSP (Shortest Path) Analytics Panels**
    *   **Location 1:** `client/src/features/analytics/components/SSSPAnalysisPanel.tsx`
    *   **Location 2:** `client/src/features/analytics/components/ShortestPathControls.tsx`
    *   **Analysis:** Both components are rendered in the `AnalyticsTab` and provide UI for Single Source Shortest Path analysis. They have significant functional overlap. `ShortestPathControls.tsx` appears to be the newer, more feature-complete version, making `SSSPAnalysisPanel.tsx` largely redundant.

### Dead Code

The following files and directories are not imported or used in the main application flow, making them dead code that can be safely removed.

*   **`client/src/app/components/RightPaneControlPanel.tsx`**: An older control panel. The application uses `IntegratedControlPanel.tsx` instead.
*   **`client/src/components/performance/` (entire directory)**: Contains `PerformanceOverlay.tsx`, which is not used.
*   **`client/src/components/tests/PerformanceTestComponent.tsx`**: A test component not used in the application.
*   **`client/src/components/HybridSystemDashboard.tsx`**: This dashboard component is not used.
*   **`client/src/features/auth/components/` (entire directory)**: `NostrAuthSection.tsx` and `AuthUIHandler.tsx` are not used in the main application.
*   **`client/src/features/auth/hooks/useAuth.ts`**: This hook is not used.
*   **`client/src/features/control-center/` (entire directory)**: The main component, `EnhancedControlCenter.tsx`, and all its tabs (`DashboardTab`, `DataManagementTab`, etc.) are not used in the application.
*   **`client/src/features/dashboard/` (entire directory)**: `DashboardPanel.tsx` is only used by the dead `EnhancedControlCenter`.
*   **`client/src/features/design-system/components/Modal.tsx`**: A custom modal implementation. The app uses the Radix-based `Dialog.tsx` instead.
*   **`client/src/features/graph/components/GraphCanvasSimple.tsx`**: A simple test file, not used.
*   **`client/src/features/graph/components/SimpleThreeTest.tsx`**: Another unused test file.
*   **`client/src/features/graph/components/GraphFeatures.tsx`**: An older implementation of graph features controls; not used.
*   **`client/src/features/graph/components/GraphFeaturesPanel.tsx`**: A panel that uses `GraphFeatures.tsx`, also unused.
*   **`client/src/features/graph/components/PostProcessingEffects.tsx`**: An older post-processing implementation. The app now uses the more modern `SelectiveBloom.tsx`.
*   **`client/src/features/graph/components/SelectionEffects.tsx`**: This component for selection visuals is not used.
*   **`client/src/features/telemetry/` (entire directory)**: This contains a full UI dashboard for telemetry that is never rendered. The application uses the simpler `DebugOverlay.tsx` and `useTelemetry.ts` from the root `src/telemetry/` directory instead.
*   **`client/src/features/visualisation/components/ActionButtons.tsx`**: Not used anywhere.
*   **`client/src/features/visualisation/components/VisualEffectsPanel.tsx`**: Not used anywhere.
*   **`client/src/features/visualisation/components/VisualEnhancementToggle.tsx`**: Not used anywhere.
*   **`client/src/features/xr/components/XRScene.tsx`**: An alternative XR implementation that is not part of the main application flow.
*   **`client/src/features/xr/components/XRController.tsx`**: This component is not used in the main `Quest3AR.tsx` flow.
*   **The complex logger system in `client/src/utils/`**: As mentioned in the "Duplicated Code" section, the following files are part of an unused logging system:
    *   `dynamicLogger.ts` and its test file.
    *   `dynamicLoggerConfig.ts`
    *   `loggerRegistry.ts`
    *   `loggerProvider.ts`
    *   `loggerDebugBridge.ts`
    *   `loggerInit.ts`
    *   `loggerIntegrationInit.ts` and its related test/demo files.
