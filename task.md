## üöÄ New Implementation: Hybrid CPU-WASM/GPU SSSP Algorithm

### Current SSSP Analysis

The existing system implements standard frontier-based Bellman-Ford SSSP, which does NOT implement the O(m log^(2/3) n) algorithm from "Breaking the Sorting Barrier" paper. The current implementation lacks:

1. **Recursive BMSSP structure** - The paper's key innovation
2. **FindPivots algorithm** - Critical for frontier reduction
3. **Sophisticated data structures** - Pull/BatchPrepend operations
4. **Divide-and-conquer approach** - Currently just iterative relaxation

### Hybrid Architecture Overview

**Strategy**: Implement a hybrid CPU-WASM/GPU approach that leverages the strengths of both architectures:
- **CPU/WASM**: Handle recursive control and sophisticated data structures
- **GPU**: Perform intensive parallel relaxation operations
- **Coordination**: Async communication between CPU and GPU contexts

## üéØ Technical Implementation Details

### Algorithm Components

#### 1. Recursive BMSSP Structure
The core innovation involves recursive partitioning with log n/t levels:
```rust
impl BMSSPAlgorithm {
    fn recursive_bmssp(&mut self, level: u32, frontier: Vec<u32>, bound: f32) -> Vec<f32> {
        if level == 0 || frontier.len() <= threshold {
            return self.gpu_relaxation(frontier, bound);
        }

        let pivots = self.find_pivots(&frontier);
        let subproblems = self.partition_by_pivots(frontier, pivots);

        // Recursively solve subproblems
        let mut results = Vec::new();
        for subproblem in subproblems {
            let sub_result = self.recursive_bmssp(level - 1, subproblem.vertices, subproblem.bound);
            results.extend(sub_result);
        }

        self.merge_results(results)
    }
}
```

#### 2. GPU-Optimized Data Structures
```rust
struct GPUAdaptiveHeap {
    blocks: Vec<HeapBlock>,
    block_size_M: u32,
    gpu_buffers: CudaBuffers,
}

impl GPUAdaptiveHeap {
    async fn pull(&mut self, count: u32) -> Vec<(u32, f32)> {
        // Extract M smallest elements efficiently
    }

    async fn insert(&mut self, items: &[(u32, f32)]) {
        // Batch insert with GPU optimization
    }

    async fn batch_prepend(&mut self, items: &[(u32, f32)]) {
        // Efficient bulk prepend operation
    }
}
```

### JavaScript Integration

```javascript
class HybridSSSPEngine {
    constructor(wasmModule, gpuContext) {
        this.coordinator = new wasmModule.HybridSSSPCoordinator();
        this.gpuContext = gpuContext;
        this.progressCallback = null;
    }

    async computeShortestPaths(graph, sourceVertex, progressCallback) {
        this.progressCallback = progressCallback;
        const result = await this.coordinator.compute_sssp(graph, sourceVertex);
        return JSON.parse(result);
    }

    getPerformanceMetrics() {
