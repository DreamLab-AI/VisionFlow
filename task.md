Let's break down what these results mean and how to fix it.
Analysis of Test Results
The Good News (What's Working)
Sections 1, 2, 3: Your Docker environment is set up correctly. Both containers are running, the internal processes (Nginx, Rust backend, MCP relay) have started successfully, and your host machine can connect to the Nginx proxy on port 3001.
Section 5: The core API endpoints for data (/graph/data, /bots/data, /user-settings) are working. This is a critical clue: it means Nginx is successfully proxying some /api requests to the Rust backend, and the backend is able to respond.
The Core Problem
The failures in sections 4, 6, and 7 all point to the same root cause: a breakdown in communication between the Nginx proxy and the Actix backend for specific types of requests:
Health Checks: Simple, quick API requests seem to be failing.
WebSocket Upgrades: All WebSocket connections (/wss, /ws/speech, /ws/mcp-relay) are failing the handshake process.
The fact that data-heavy endpoints work while health checks and WebSockets fail strongly suggests an issue with how Nginx is configured to handle different types of connections and proxy them to the backend.
Detailed Breakdown of Failures
API Health Endpoints (FAILED):
Reason: The test script checks /api/health and /api/mcp/health. The failure (Code 4) means jq received valid JSON but the expression '.status == "healthy"' or '.mcp_relay_running == true' was false. This indicates the request reached the backend, but the backend reported an unhealthy state. This is likely a symptom of the underlying connection issues.
WebSocket Handshake Tests (FAILED):
Reason: The wscat command is failing to establish a connection. This means the HTTP Upgrade request, which is necessary to switch from HTTP to WebSocket, is failing at the Nginx proxy level. Nginx is not correctly forwarding the upgrade request to the Rust backend.
API Integration Flows (Hanging):
Reason: The initialize-swarm test is hanging because it makes a POST request to /api/bots/initialize-swarm. This endpoint in the Rust backend needs to communicate with the powerdev container via the MCP relay. The logs you provided show Connection refused (os error 111), which confirms the Rust backend cannot reach the MCP relay in the powerdev container. This is a separate Docker networking issue.
Action Plan to Fix the Issues
We'll address the Nginx proxy issue first, as it's the primary cause of the test failures, and then ensure the Docker networking is correct.
Step 1: Verify Docker Network
First, let's ensure both containers are on the same network, which is required for them to communicate.
Run this command to inspect the network:
Generated bash
docker network inspect docker_ragflow
Use code with caution.
Bash
Look for the "Containers" section in the output. You should see both logseq_spring_thing_webxr and powerdev listed there. If not, there is a problem with your docker-compose.dev.yml network configuration.
Step 2: Fix the Nginx Configuration
The nginx.dev.conf file needs to be more robust in how it handles different locations. The current configuration is likely causing conflicts or incorrect proxying for WebSocket and some API routes.
Replace the server block in your nginx.dev.conf file with this corrected version:
Generated conf
# In nginx.dev.conf
server {
    listen 3001 default_server;
    server_name localhost;

    # Enable SharedArrayBuffer for performance optimizations
    add_header Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy "same-origin" always;
    add_header Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy "require-corp" always;

    # Location for Vite's Hot Module Replacement (HMR) WebSocket
    location /ws {
        proxy_pass http://vite_hmr;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_read_timeout 86400;
    }

    # Regex location to catch ALL WebSocket endpoints from the backend
    location ~ ^/(wss|ws/speech|ws/mcp-relay)$ {
        proxy_pass http://backend;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_read_timeout 600m; # 10 hours for long-lived connections
        proxy_buffering off;
    }

    # Location for all backend API calls
    location /api {
        proxy_pass http://backend;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_read_timeout 120s;
    }

    # Location for the Vite development server (frontend assets)
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://vite_dev_server;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
    }
}
Use code with caution.
Conf
Why this works:
Specific WebSocket Regex: The location ~ ^/(wss|ws/speech|ws/mcp-relay)$ block uses a regular expression to specifically catch all backend WebSocket endpoints. This ensures they are handled with the correct Upgrade headers and long timeouts, separate from regular API calls.
Clear Separation: Each location block now has a very specific purpose, preventing conflicts where a generic /api block might incorrectly handle a WebSocket request.

the nginx is copied into the docker at build time when we run scripts/dev.sh and we need to be very careful about all these routes and the interactions with vite. it's quite brittle.  use the ext/docs to guide you and try to form a complette picture before acting. Adjust the code in light of the expectations of ext/claude-flow in terms of it's json payloads. don't write more test scripts, just examine until you're really sure using the full power of your hive-mind.
