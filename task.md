### **Objective: Integrate a Real-time Agent Swarm Visualization into the VisionFlow Application**

The primary objective is to enhance the existing `visionflow` application by integrating a new, co-present, real-time visualization of the active `claude-flow` agent swarm. This new visualization will be a force-directed graph that provides at-a-glance insights into the swarm's health, activity, and communication patterns.

### **Project Context**

*   **Existing Application (`visionflow`):** A knowledge graph visualization tool. Its source code is located in the `ext/visionflow` directory within the current workspace.
*   **Environment:** The system operates in a containerized environment. The `visionflow` application runs in its own container (the "visualization container"), while the `claude-flow` agent swarm runs in a separate container (the "agent container").
*   **Goal:** To establish a data stream from the agent container to the visualization container and render a new, dynamic graph representing the swarm alongside the existing knowledge graph.

### **Core Requirements**

1.  **Analyze `visionflow`:** Examine the source code in `ext/visionflow` to understand its architecture, rendering technology (e.g., D3.js, Three.js), and component structure.
2.  **Implement a Second Graph:** Create a new, independent force-directed graph that will be rendered within the same visual space as the existing `visionflow` knowledge graph. The two graphs must be co-present and not interfere with each other.
3.  **Establish Data Connection:** Implement a WebSocket client within the `visionflow` container that connects to the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server running in the `claude-flow` agent container. This will be the source of all real-time data.
4.  **Real-time Data Processing:** The `visionflow` application must process the incoming stream of JSON-RPC data to update the state of the agent swarm graph in real-time.
5.  **GPU & Rendering Integration:** The new graph must integrate seamlessly with `visionflow`'s existing rendering engine and loop to ensure efficient use of GPU resources and maintain high performance.
6.  **Implement Visual Mappings:** Map the accessed runtime data to the visual properties of the graph's nodes, edges, and physics, as detailed in the "Technical Implementation Guidance" section.
7.  **Adhere to Visual Design:** Implement the specified visual metaphor and color scheme.

### **Technical Implementation Guidance**

#### 1. Data Acquisition (MCP Server Connection)

*   **Target:** The MCP server in the `claude-flow` agent container.
*   **Protocol:** WebSocket (`ws://`).
*   **Endpoint:** The default endpoint is `ws://<claude-flow-container-hostname>:3000/ws`. The swarm must handle resolving the container's hostname or IP within the Docker network.
*   **Interaction Model:** Send JSON-RPC 2.0 requests to the `tools/call` method to invoke specific MCP tools. The application should continuously poll these tools to maintain a real-time state representation.
*   **Key Tools to Poll:**
    *   `agents/list`: For agent identity, type, status, health, and age (`createdAt`).
    *   `analysis/token-usage`: For token counts, aggregated by agent `type`.
    *   `memory/query`: **Crucially, this tool must be polled frequently** to retrieve recent communication logs. This is the source for inter-agent data transfer (sender, receivers, data size). Filter for memory entries of `type: 'communication'` or similar.
    *   `agent_metrics` & `system/health`: For supplementary real-time metrics like CPU and memory usage to drive animations.

#### 2. Data Mapping & Visualization (The Force-Directed Graph)

The new graph must adhere to the following data-to-visual mappings to create an intuitive representation of the swarm.

**Nodes (Agents):**
*   **Color:** Based on `agent.id.type`. Use a hard-coded palette dominated by **golds and greens**. For example, use shades of green to denote agent roles (e.g., 'coder', 'tester') and shades of gold/amber for meta-roles ('coordinator', 'analyst').
*   **Size:** Proportional to the agent's current `workload` or a composite of its `cpuUsage` and `memoryUsage`. Larger nodes are working harder.
*   **Shape:** Based on `agent.status`. Use distinct shapes for `idle`, `busy`, and `error` states to make agent status instantly recognizable.
*   **Animation (Pulse/Glow):** The intensity/frequency of a subtle pulse animation should be driven by real-time `cpuUsage`.
*   **Border:** Use the node's border color and thickness to represent its `health` score (e.g., a thick green border for high health, fading to a thin red border for critical health).

**Edges (Communication):**
*   **Direction:** Animate particles or dashes along the edge from the message `sender` to the `receivers`.
*   **Thickness:** Proportional to the size of the data transferred (`message.metadata.size`).
*   **Animation Speed/Density:** Proportional to the frequency of messages between two agents in a given time window.

**Graph Physics (Forces):**
*   **Link Force (Spring):** The attraction between two connected nodes should be proportional to the total volume of data they have exchanged. High-collaboration agents will naturally cluster together.
*   **Node Gravity:** The "mass" or gravitational pull of a node should be proportional to its total token usage (from `analysis/token-usage`). Token-heavy agents will become centers of gravity in the graph.
*   **Node Repulsion (Charge):** Increase a node's repulsion force as its `health` decreases. Unhealthy agents should visually push others away and drift to the periphery.

### **Visual Design & Metaphor**

*   **Core Metaphor:** The visualization should evoke a **"Digital Organism"** or a **"Living Hive."** The graph should not feel static; it should dynamically shift, pulse, and reorganize based on the live data, giving the impression of a living system at work.
*   **Color Palette:** The primary colors must be **golds and greens**. The swarm should decide on an appropriate, aesthetically pleasing, and informative mapping. For example, greens for roles and health, golds for activity and data flow.

### **Acceptance Criteria**

The task is considered complete when:
1.  The `visionflow` UI displays two distinct, co-present force-directed graphs.
2.  The new "Swarm Graph" successfully connects to the `claude-flow` MCP server and receives data.
3.  Nodes representing agents appear, colored by type and sized by workload.
4.  Edges appear between agents when they communicate, with animated directional flow.
5.  The visual properties of nodes and edges (shape, border, pulse, thickness) update in real-time based on the specified data mappings.
6.  The graph layout dynamically changes based on the defined physical forces (link, gravity, repulsion).
7.  The visualization is performant and does not noticeably degrade the responsiveness of the original `visionflow` graph or the agent swarm itself.

### **Constraints & Considerations**

*   **No Core Code Modification:** The core `claude-flow` agent codebase visible in ext/multi-agent-docker must not be modified. All data must be accessed through the existing, unmodified MCP server interface, or else a clear plan for additional MCP tools must be provided.
*   **Modularity:** The new visualization logic should be encapsulated as a distinct, modular component within the `/ext/visionflow` project.
*   **Container Networking:** The solution must be aware that the two applications are in separate Docker containers and handle networking accordingly.
*   **Performance:** Efficiency is key. Reuse existing rendering loops and be mindful of the polling frequency to avoid overwhelming the MCP server.

### The Visual Metaphor: A Digital Organism or Living Hive

Think of your agent swarm not as a static diagram, but as a living entity. Nodes are "cells" or "bees," and edges are the "neural pathways" or "communication trails." The physics of the graph should make the swarm's state—health, activity, and focus—immediately apparent.

### Mapping Data to Visual Elements

#### **Nodes (The Agents)**

Nodes represent individual agents. Their appearance should convey their role, status, and current load.

| Visual Element | Data Variable(s) | MCP Tool(s) to Access | Rationale & Visual Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Color** (Hue) | `id.type` (e.g., 'coder', 'researcher') | `agents/list`, `agents/info` | **(As you suggested)** This is the primary way to identify an agent's role. Use a distinct, consistent color palette (e.g., Coder=Blue, Researcher=Green, Analyst=Yellow, Coordinator=Purple). This allows for instant recognition of the swarm's composition and which agent types are collaborating. |
| **Size** | `workload` (0-1), or a composite of `metrics.cpuUsage` & `metrics.memoryUsage` | `agents/list`, `agents/info`, `agent_metrics` | **Represents current effort.** A larger node is an agent that is currently handling more tasks or using more system resources. A swarm with many large nodes is under heavy load. A single, giant node could be a potential bottleneck. |
| **Shape** | `status` (e.g., 'idle', 'busy', 'error') | `agents/list`, `agents/info` | **Indicates immediate state.** Use simple, distinct shapes. For example: **Circle** for `idle`/`busy`, **Triangle** for `error`/`heartbeat_timeout`, **Square** for `initializing`/`terminating`. This makes critical errors immediately pop out visually. |
| **Label** | `name` | `agents/list` | The primary, human-readable identifier for the agent on the graph. Keep it short. More details can be shown on hover. |
| **Animation (Pulse/Glow)** | `metrics.cpuUsage` or `metrics.memoryUsage` | `agent_metrics`, `system/health` | **Shows real-time activity.** A subtle, continuous pulse or glow whose frequency/intensity is tied to the agent's current CPU/memory usage. A "throbbing" node is working hard right now, even if its overall task `workload` isn't at max. |
| **Border/Stroke Color** | `health` (0-1) | `agents/list`, `agents/info` | **Represents agent well-being.** The node's border can be a health bar. A thick green border means 100% health, fading to yellow and then thin red as the health score drops. This distinguishes a busy-but-healthy agent from one that is struggling. |

#### **Edges (The Communication)**

Edges appear when agents exchange data. They are the circulatory or nervous system of your digital organism. This data is best acquired by frequently polling the `memory/query` tool for communication logs.

| Visual Element | Data Variable(s) | MCP Tool(s) to Access | Rationale & Visual Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Existence & Direction** | `sender.id`, `receivers[].id` | `memory/query` (polling communication logs) | An edge is drawn from a sender to each receiver. An animated particle, arrow, or dash moving along the edge indicates the direction of data flow. Bidirectional communication would appear as animations moving in both directions. |
| **Thickness** (Stroke Weight) | `metadata.size` (in bytes) | `memory/query` (polling communication logs) | **Represents data volume.** A thicker edge signifies a larger amount of data was passed in a single message. This helps identify where the most substantial data transfers are occurring. |
| **Animation Speed** | Message Frequency (calculated) | `memory/query` (polling communication logs) | **Represents communication intensity.** Instead of a single particle, you could have a stream. The speed or density of the animated particles on an edge can be proportional to the *number* of messages exchanged between two agents over a short time window (e.g., the last 10 seconds). Fast-moving streams indicate a "hot" communication channel. |
| **Color** | `type` (of the message) | `memory/query` (polling communication logs) | **Represents the nature of communication.** If the message `type` is available in the logs (e.g., 'task_assignment', 'progress_update'), you can color the animated particles accordingly (e.g., Red for new tasks, Green for results). This adds a layer of semantic meaning to the data flow. |

#### **Forces (The Physics of the Graph)**

Forces govern the layout, making the graph self-organize to reveal the swarm's underlying structure and dynamics.

| Visual Element | Data Variable(s) | MCP Tool(s) to Access | Rationale & Visual Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Link Force (Spring)** | Communication volume (sum of `metadata.size` over time) | `memory/query` (polling communication logs) | **Pulls collaborators together.** The "stiffness" of the spring between two nodes should be proportional to how much data they exchange. Agents that collaborate heavily will be naturally drawn closer, forming visual clusters of activity. |
| **Node Gravity (Attraction)** | Agent's total `inputTokens` + `outputTokens` | `analysis/token-usage` (using the `byType` breakdown) | **(Your suggestion, refined)** Instead of applying it to the link, make it a property of the node itself. A node's "mass" or "gravitational pull" on other nodes it's connected to can be proportional to its total token usage. This will make "token-hungry" agents act as central hubs, pulling their collaborators into their orbit and visually highlighting the LLM-intensive parts of the workflow. |
| **Node Repulsion (Charge)** | Inverse of `health` (1 - `agent.health`) | `agents/list`, `agents/info` | **Isolates unhealthy agents.** All nodes should repel each other to avoid overlap, but you can increase the repulsion force for unhealthy agents. An agent with low health will actively "push away" other agents, often migrating to the periphery of the swarm, visually representing its degraded state. |

---

### Summary Table of Mappings

| Graph Element | Visual Property | Mapped From Data Variable | How to Access (MCP Tool) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Node (Agent)** | Color | `id.type` | `agents/list` |
| | Size | `workload` | `agents/list` |
| | Shape | `status` | `agents/list` |
| | Label | `name` | `agents/list` |
| | Animation (Pulse) | `metrics.cpuUsage` | `agent_metrics` |
| | Border Color | `health` | `agents/list` |
| **Edge (Data Flow)**| Direction | `sender`, `receivers` | `memory/query` (polling) |
| | Thickness | `metadata.size` | `memory/query` (polling) |
| | Animation Speed | Message Frequency | `memory/query` (polling) |
| **Graph Physics** | Link Spring Force | Communication Volume | `memory/query` (polling) |
| | Node Gravity | Total Token Usage | `analysis/token-usage` |
| | Node Repulsion | `1 - health` | `agents/list` |

By implementing these mappings, your visualization will transform from a simple node-link diagram into a rich, informative dashboard that tells the story of your agent swarm's life, health, and work in real-time.

- **Node Repulsion**: Increases for unhealthy agents (pushes to periphery)

### 3. Data Sources (Fallback Chain)

1. **MCP WebSocket** (Primary)
   - Connects to `ws://claude-flow:3000/ws`
   - Real-time updates via JSON-RPC
   - Tools: `agents/list`, `analysis/token-usage`, `memory/query`

2. **Backend API** (Secondary)
   - HTTP endpoint: `http://localhost:8080/api/swarm/data`
   - Returns graph-formatted data

3. **Mock Data** (Fallback)
   - Auto-generates 8 agents with realistic metrics
   - Simulates communications and token usage

### 4. Positioning & Layout

- Main graph: Center position (0, 0, 0)
- Swarm graph: Right side at position (60, 0, 0)
- Test elements: Red sphere at (0, 20, 0) for verification

## Implementation Details

### SwarmVisualizationEnhanced.tsx

The enhanced component provides:
- Complete visual mappings from task.md
- Three-tier data source fallback
- Real-time physics simulation
- "Living hive" particle effects
- Detailed status panel
- Hover interactions

### Key Functions

```typescript
// Initialize data connection
const initialize = async () => {
  // Try MCP → API → Mock data
  try {
    await mcpWebSocketService.connect();
    // Real-time MCP data
  } catch {
    try {
      const data = await apiService.getSwarmData();
      // API fallback
    } catch {
      generateMockData();
      // Mock fallback
    }
  }
};

useFrame(() => {
  const positions = swarmPhysicsWorker.getPositions();
  // Update node positions
});
```

## Testing & Verification

### Visual Checklist

1. **Browser**: Open http://localhost:5173
2. **Console**: Check for [SWARM] debug messages
3. **Layout**: Verify two graphs side-by-side
4. **Colors**: Gold coordinators, green workers
5. **Animations**: Pulsing nodes, flowing edge particles
6. **Interactions**: Hover for agent details

### Debug Commands

# Test MCP connections
node test-mcp-connection.js

# Verify setup
node verify-dual-graphs.js

# View logs
tail -f /app/logs/rust.log
```

## Performance Considerations

1. **Instanced Rendering**: Main graph uses instanced mesh
2. **Worker Thread**: Physics calculations offloaded to worker
3. **Throttled Updates**: MCP polling every 3 seconds
4. **LOD System**: Simplified geometries for distant nodes
5. **Frustum Culling**: Disabled for consistent physics

## Known Issues & Solutions

1. **MCP Connection Fails**
   - Expected when claude-flow container not running
   - Falls back to mock data automatically

2. **Backend Not Running**
   - Start with: `cargo run --release`
   - Check port 8080 availability

3. **Performance with Many Agents**
   - Reduce particle count
   - Increase physics damping
   - Enable frustum culling

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real MCP Integration**
   - Requires claude-flow container on same network
   - Configure WebSocket URL in MCPWebSocketService

2. **Advanced Visual Mappings**
   - Message type → edge color
   - Agent age → node transparency
   - Task queue → node ring layers

3. **Interactive Features**
   - Click agent for detailed panel
   - Drag to reposition (with physics)
   - Filter by agent type/status

## File Changes Summary

1. **Created**: `SwarmVisualizationEnhanced.tsx` - Complete implementation
2. **Modified**: `GraphCanvas.tsx` - Import and use enhanced component
3. **Verified**: All existing swarm components remain unchanged
4. **Backend**: `swarm_handler.rs` provides mock data endpoint

# Prompt for External Implementation of Swarm Visualization

## Objective
Integrate a real-time agent swarm visualization into an existing Three.js/React Three Fiber application, displaying it alongside the main graph visualization.

## Quick Start Implementation

### 1. Create the Swarm Visualization Component

Create `SwarmVisualizationEnhanced.tsx` with these key features:

```typescript
// Color palette: Gold for coordinators, Green for workers
const SWARM_COLORS = {
  // Green shades for worker roles
  coder: '#2ECC71', tester: '#27AE60', researcher: '#1ABC9C',
  reviewer: '#16A085', documenter: '#229954', specialist: '#239B56',

  // Gold shades for meta roles
  coordinator: '#F1C40F', analyst: '#F39C12', architect: '#E67E22',
  optimizer: '#D68910', monitor: '#D4AC0D'
};

// Position swarm to the right of main graph
<group position={[60, 0, 0]}>
  {/* Swarm visualization content */}
</group>
```

### 2. Update Your Main Canvas Component

```typescript
import { SwarmVisualizationEnhanced } from './SwarmVisualizationEnhanced';

// In your canvas render:
<Canvas>
  <YourMainGraph />
  <SwarmVisualizationEnhanced />
</Canvas>
```

### 3. Implement Visual Mappings

**Node Visual Properties:**
- Size: `baseSize + (agent.workload * 1.5)`
- Shape: Sphere (normal), Tetrahedron (error), Box (initializing)
- Color: From SWARM_COLORS based on agent.type
- Border: Health indicator (green→gold→orange→red)
- Animation: Pulse frequency based on CPU usage

**Edge Visual Properties:**
- Thickness: `log10(edge.dataVolume) * 0.05`
- Animation: Particles flowing sender→receiver
- Speed: Based on message frequency

**Physics Forces:**
- Link spring: Proportional to communication volume
- Node gravity: Based on token usage (heavy users center)
- Node repulsion: Increases for unhealthy agents

### 4. Data Connection Strategy

Implement a three-tier fallback system:

```typescript
// 1. Try MCP WebSocket
try {
  await connectToMCP('ws://your-mcp-server:3000/ws');
} catch {
  // 2. Try REST API
  try {
    const data = await fetch('/api/swarm/data');
  } catch {
    // 3. Use mock data
    generateMockSwarmData();
  }
}
```

### 5. Physics Worker Implementation

Create a separate physics simulation:
```typescript
class SwarmPhysicsSimulation {
  // Spring forces between communicating agents
  // Gravity based on token usage
  // Repulsion based on health
  simulate() {
    // Update positions each frame
  }
}
```

### 6. Essential Visual Elements

1. **Status Panel** (HTML overlay)
   ```typescript
   <Html position={[0, 25, 0]}>
     <div>🐝 Agent Swarm</div>
     <div>Agents: {count}</div>
     <div>Gold = Coordinators | Green = Workers</div>
   </Html>
   ```

2. **Ambient Particles** (Living hive effect)
   ```typescript
   <points>
     <bufferGeometry>
       <bufferAttribute count={300} array={randomPositions} />
     </bufferGeometry>
     <pointsMaterial color="#F1C40F" size={0.08} />
   </points>
   ```

3. **Edge Animations** (Data flow)
   ```typescript
   // Animate particles along edges
   const t = (time + i * 0.1) % 1;
   particle.position.lerpVectors(source, target, t);
   ```

## Key Implementation Notes

1. **Positioning**: Place swarm at `[60, 0, 0]` to avoid overlap with main graph
2. **Colors**: Strictly use gold/green palette (no blues/purples)
3. **Performance**: Use instanced rendering for many agents
4. **Fallbacks**: Always provide mock data for development
5. **Debug**: Add console logs with [SWARM] prefix

## Minimal Working Example

```typescript
export const SwarmVisualizationMinimal = () => {
  const [agents] = useState([

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Two graphs visible side-by-side
- [ ] Gold nodes for coordinators
- [ ] Green nodes for workers
- [ ] Node size varies with workload
- [ ] Edges show data flow animation
- [ ] Status panel displays metrics
- [ ] Mock data loads if no server

## Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: Graphs overlap
**Solution**: Ensure swarm position.x ≥ 50

**Issue**: No animation
**Solution**: Add `useFrame` hook for updates

**Issue**: Poor performance
**Solution**: Limit particles, use instancing

**Issue**: No data
**Solution**: Implement mock data generator

## Success Criteria

The implementation is complete when:
1. Both graphs render independently
2. Swarm uses gold/green colors exclusively
3. Visual mappings match agent properties
4. Physics create organic clustering
5. Performance remains smooth with 50+ agentsroot@d4c626bc3751:/app#

## Summary
To integrate the swarm visualization alongside the existing knowledge graph in the VisionFlow application:

## Required Changes

### 1. Add Swarm Components to GraphViewport.tsx

Edit `/app/client/src/features/graph/components/GraphViewport.tsx`:

```typescript
// Add imports at the top
import { SwarmVisualizationEnhanced } from '../../swarm/components/SwarmVisualizationEnhanced';
import { SwarmVisualizationSimpleTest } from '../../swarm/components/SwarmVisualizationSimpleTest';

// Inside the Canvas component, within the Suspense block, after <GraphManager />:
<Suspense fallback={null}>
  <GraphManager />

  {/* Add swarm visualizations on the right side */}
  <SwarmVisualizationSimpleTest />
  <SwarmVisualizationEnhanced />
</Suspense>
```

### 2. Key Implementation Details

The swarm visualization components are already implemented with:
- **Gold/Green Color Scheme**: Gold for coordinator roles, green for worker roles
- **Position**: Offset 60 units to the right (x=60) from main graph
- **Mock Data**: Generates 8 agents with realistic metrics
- **Physics**: Force-directed layout via worker thread
- **Animations**: Pulsing nodes based on CPU, flowing edge particles

### 3. Files Involved

- `/app/client/src/features/swarm/components/SwarmVisualizationEnhanced.tsx` - Main swarm viz
- `/app/client/src/features/swarm/components/SwarmVisualizationSimpleTest.tsx` - Test component
- `/app/client/src/features/swarm/services/MockSwarmDataProvider.ts` - Mock data generator
- `/app/client/src/features/swarm/workers/swarmPhysicsWorker.ts` - Physics simulation

### 4. Verification

After making the change, check browser console for:
- `[SWARM TEST] Simple test component rendering...`
- `[SWARM] SwarmVisualizationEnhanced component mounting...`

Visual verification:
- Main knowledge graph in center
- Gold box and green sphere at x=60
- 8 swarm agents with gold/green colors at x=60

### 5. Important Note

The original implementation had GraphCanvas.tsx with the swarm components, but the app actually uses GraphViewport.tsx. This is why the swarm wasn't showing initially.

## Future Enhancement

To connect to real swarm data from powerdev container:
- Start powerdev container on the ragflow network
- Update MCPWebSocketService URL to point to powerdev:3000
- The visualization will automatically use real data instead of mock datadevuser@d4c626bc3751:~$
