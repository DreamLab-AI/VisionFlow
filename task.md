Of course. Here is a comprehensive list of all the files involved in the REST API communication flow, from the client request to the server's response, based on the provided file structure and logs.
The primary example we can trace is the POST /api/settings call, which is failing in your logs.
Summary of the Flow
The communication for saving settings follows this path:
Client UI → Zustand Store → API Service → Nginx Proxy → Rust Backend (Handler → Actor → Config Logic) → settings.yaml file
1. Client-Side Files (Request Flow)
These files are responsible for initiating the API call from the browser.
client/src/features/visualisation/components/IntegratedControlPanel.tsx: The UI component where a user interacts with a setting (e.g., clicks a button or moves a slider). The onClick handler triggers the process.
client/src/store/settingsStore.ts: The Zustand state management store. It receives the update from the UI, modifies the client-side state, and then calls a debounced function (debouncedSaveToServer) to send the changes to the backend.
client/src/services/apiService.ts: A generic service that abstracts the actual fetch call. The post method in this file constructs and sends the HTTP POST request to /api/settings.
client/src/features/settings/config/settings.ts: This TypeScript file defines the Settings interface, which is the data structure of the object being sent to the server as the JSON payload.
2. Server-Side Files (Request Processing & Response Flow)
These Rust files on the backend receive the request, process it, save the data, and send a response.
nginx.dev.conf: In your development environment, Nginx acts as a reverse proxy. It receives the request on port 3001 and forwards any request to /api/* to the Rust backend running on port 4000.
src/main.rs: The main entry point of the Rust application. It sets up the Actix web server and registers the API routes, including the /api scope which is configured in api_handler.
src/handlers/api_handler/mod.rs: This module configures all the API sub-routes. It directs requests for /api/settings to the settings_handler.
src/handlers/settings_handler.rs: This is the core handler for the /api/settings endpoint. The update_settings function receives the JSON payload from the client.
src/app_state.rs: Defines the shared application state, including the addresses for all the actors. The settings_handler uses this to get the address of the SettingsActor.
src/actors/settings_actor.rs: An Actix actor that manages the application's settings in memory. The settings_handler sends an UpdateSettings message to this actor.
src/actors/messages.rs: Defines the message types (like UpdateSettings and GetSettings) that actors use to communicate with each other.
src/config/mod.rs: This is a critical file. It defines the main AppFullSettings Rust struct that the incoming JSON is ultimately deserialized into. It contains the merge_update logic for applying partial updates and the save method for writing to the YAML file.
data/settings.yaml: The final destination. The save() method in src/config/mod.rs serializes the AppFullSettings struct into YAML format and overwrites this file.
3. Shared Data Models & Utilities
These files define the data structures and logic used for converting data between the client and server.
Client-Side Model: client/src/features/settings/config/settings.ts (Defines the Settings interface in camelCase).
Server-Side Model: src/config/mod.rs (Defines the AppFullSettings struct and all its nested structs in snake_case).
Data Conversion Logic:
src/utils/caseConversion.ts (Client-side, though not explicitly used in the settings flow, it's a common pattern).
src/config/mod.rs contains the keys_to_snake_case and keys_to_camel_case helper functions that perform the critical conversion between the client's JSON and the server's struct format.
4. Configuration Files
These files configure the behavior of the client and server, including ports and URLs.
client/vite.config.ts: Configures the Vite development server, including the HMR WebSocket port.
docker-compose.dev.yml: Defines the services, ports, and environment variables for the development environment, tying Nginx, Vite, and the Rust backend together.
.env / .env_template: Contains environment variables, including API keys and potentially the backend URL, which are loaded by Docker Compose.
