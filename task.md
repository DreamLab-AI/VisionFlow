## Implementation Complete

The neural integration has been successfully implemented with the following components:

1. **NeuralSwarmController** - Manages neural mesh networks with swarm intelligence
2. **NeuralActorSystem** - Cognitive-aware actor system with codex-syntaptic patterns
3. **NeuralGpuService** - GPU-accelerated neural processing with CUDA support
4. **NeuralWebSocketHandler** - Real-time neural communication with cognitive profiles
5. **NeuralDockerOrchestrator** - Container orchestration with neural awareness
6. **NeuralConsensus** - Distributed consensus with cognitive decision-making
7. **NeuralMemory** - Persistent memory system with pattern recognition

All modules are integrated with codex-syntaptic cognitive patterns and provide comprehensive neural enhancement to the swarm controller.
