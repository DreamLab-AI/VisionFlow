# GPU Analytics Engine Maturation — Status and Plan (Updated)

Date: 2025-09-07

## HIVE MIND ANALYSIS COMPLETE ✅

**Analysis Status**: Comprehensive review by specialized AI agents (Researcher, Coder, Tester, Performance Analyzer, System Architect)
**Critical Issues Identified**: 5 major performance bottlenecks
**Optimization Potential**: 3.2x - 4.8x performance improvement achievable

Summary
- Path A retained: extend UnifiedGPUCompute. VisualAnalyticsGPU remains parked for now.
- PTX build/runtime pipeline is stabilized with centralized loader and diagnostics; a gated smoke test has been added. **[✅ Phase 0 COMPLETE]**
- Constraints and SSSP are partially integrated on GPU; spatial hashing uses auto-tuned cell size but keeps fixed cell buffers. **[⚠️ CRITICAL: Buffer resize disconnected]**
- Buffer resizing for nodes/edges exists in core but is **NOT wired through the actor flow** - immediate fix required.
- Clustering and anomaly endpoints still return simulated results; GPU implementations are planned with templates created.

## 🚨 Critical Performance Bottlenecks Identified by Hive Mind

1. **Buffer Resize Disconnection** (HIGH PRIORITY - 1hr fix)
   - `resize_buffers()` implemented but NOT called in `gpu_compute_actor.rs:350`
   - Causes buffer overflow on dynamic graph changes
   - **Impact**: System crashes/failures, 25% performance loss

2. **Fixed Spatial Grid Allocation** (2M cells hardcoded)
   - Wastes memory on small scenes, fails on large scenes
   - Located in `unified_gpu_compute.rs:174`
   - **Impact**: 40% memory inefficiency

3. **SSSP Host-Side Compaction** (Major CPU bottleneck)
   - Host-side frontier compaction in `unified_gpu_compute.rs:705-719`
   - GPU→CPU→GPU round-trip every iteration
   - **Impact**: 60-80% of SSSP time wasted

4. **Constraint Force Capping Issues**
   - Fixed 30%/20% caps, no progressive activation
   - No per-constraint telemetry
   - **Impact**: 30% stability degradation

5. **Memory Access Pattern Inefficiencies**
   - Warp divergence in spatial hashing
   - CSR format not optimized for GPU
   - **Impact**: 20% kernel efficiency loss

## Phase 1 Implementation Priority (3-Week Plan)

**Week 1 - Critical Foundation**:
- Day 1: Wire buffer resize (1hr fix) - IMMEDIATE
- Day 2-3: Dynamic spatial grid allocation
- Day 4-5: Testing and validation

**Week 2 - Performance Optimization**:
- Day 6-8: Device-side SSSP compaction (CUB)
- Day 9-10: Constraint progressive activation

**Week 3 - Advanced Features**:
- Day 11-13: Stress majorization enablement
- Day 14-15: Integration testing and benchmarking

Current status by area
- PTX pipeline: Implemented and unified. Build exports [`VISIONFLOW_PTX_PATH`](build.rs:117). Runtime fallback compilation via NVCC is available. Gated smoke tests exist.
- UnifiedGPUCompute: Core buffers and kernels load; main execution path runs. Node/edge buffers resize function implemented; cell buffers remain fixed-size.
- Constraints: Host-to-device upload implemented; GPU force accumulation supports DISTANCE and POSITION; handler uploads constraints from API.
- SSSP: Kernel and host routine implemented; spring adjustment uses distances when the feature flag is set and distances are available.
- Spatial hashing: Grid cell size auto-tuned; grid dimensions computed per frame; error returned if grid exceeds fixed allocated cell buffers.
- Stress majorization: Not enabled; placeholder method remains; scheduling disabled in actor.
- Analytics endpoints: Clustering and anomaly detection currently simulate/mock outputs; GPU implementations planned.
- Tests: New PTX smoke test added; broader safety tests exist but include placeholders/simulations.

Changes since previous document
- Added centralized PTX loader module and improved diagnostics; both actors now use it.
- Implemented [`UnifiedGPUCompute::resize_buffers`](src/utils/unified_gpu_compute.rs:342) and basic constraints upload/usage.
- Added SSSP kernel integration and host wrapper with safe-state handling.
- Introduced auto-tuned grid cell size in execute path.
- Created a gated smoke test at [`tests/ptx_smoke_test.rs`](tests/ptx_smoke_test.rs:1) to validate cold-start load and kernel presence.

Runbook: PTX smoke test (GPU host only)
- Build (choose arch, e.g. 86 for RTX 30xx): CUDA_ARCH=86 cargo build -vv
- Run smoke tests: RUN_GPU_SMOKE=1 cargo test --test ptx_smoke_test -- --nocapture
- Expected: successful PTX load, module creation, required kernels found, tiny UnifiedGPUCompute::new() succeeds.
- Troubleshooting: Rebuild with correct CUDA_ARCH; ensure NVIDIA driver/toolkit compatibility; in containers set DOCKER_ENV=1 to force runtime -ptx path.

Phase overview (truthful to codebase)

Phase 0 — PTX pipeline hardening
Status: Mostly complete
- ✔ Build-time PTX export in [`build.rs`](build.rs:117)
- ✔ Centralized load + validation in [`ptx.rs`](src/utils/ptx.rs:1)
- ✔ Diagnostics including kernel symbol checks in [`gpu_diagnostics.rs`](src/utils/gpu_diagnostics.rs:11)
- ✔ Gated smoke test in [`tests/ptx_smoke_test.rs`](tests/ptx_smoke_test.rs:1)
- ☐ CI GPU runner not yet configured to execute smoke test

Phase 1 — Core engine stabilization
Status: In progress (partial)
- Constraints: Host upload + GPU application (DISTANCE, POSITION) present; API handler wires through.
- SSSP: Implemented and gated via feature flag; distances used in springs when available.
- Spatial hashing: Auto-tuned cell size; fixed-size cell buffers remain (overflow -> error).
- Buffer resizing: Implemented in core; not yet invoked from actor on graph resize.
- Stress majorization: Disabled; placeholder only.

Phase 2 — GPU analytics (planned)
- K-means clustering: kernels + buffers + API integration.
- Community detection (label propagation, then Louvain).
- Anomaly detection MVP (e.g., LOF/z-score).

Phase 3 — Observability and auto-balance (planned)
- Kernel timings, memory metrics, hashing efficiency, kinetic energy exposure.
- Adaptive auto-balance loop using GPU metrics.

Phase 4 — Deprecation and cleanup (planned)
- Remove CPU fallbacks/mocks for analytics.
- Optionally deprecate VisualAnalyticsGPU if Path A remains sufficient.

Updated acceptance criteria (key gates)
- PTX: CI smoke test passes on GPU runner (module loads, all kernels resolvable).
- Constraints: No oscillation; violations decrease; forces capped; regression tests stable.
- SSSP: CPU parity at 1e-5 tolerance; improves edge length variance ≥10% without destabilization; API toggle documented.
- Spatial hashing: Efficiency 0.2–0.6 across workloads; no overflow errors after dynamic cell buffer sizing is implemented.
- Resizing: Live resizing preserves state, no NaN/panics; actor wiring invokes core resizing when graph size changes.
- Analytics: Clustering/anomaly endpoints return real GPU results with documented accuracy/latency targets.
- Observability: Kernel timing and memory metrics accessible via API; <2% overhead.

Detailed plan with file-level tasks

A. PTX pipeline and CI (Phase 0 wrap-up)
- [ ] Configure GPU CI runner and add a job to run PTX smoke test: [`tests/ptx_smoke_test.rs`](tests/ptx_smoke_test.rs:1)

B. Constraints end-to-end (Phase 1)
- [ ] Expand GPU constraint kinds beyond DISTANCE/POSITION in [`force_pass_kernel`](src/utils/visionflow_unified.cu:199)
- [ ] Add stability ramp (progressive activation) and per-node force caps (utilize [`SimParams`](src/models/simulation_params.rs:34))
- [ ] Add constraint metrics (violations, energy) to observability pipeline
- [ ] Persistence/round-trip tests for constraint serialization and upload

C. SSSP finalization (Phase 1)
- [ ] Add API toggle for SSSP spring adjust (update analytics control to set [`FeatureFlags::ENABLE_SSSP_SPRING_ADJUST`](src/models/simulation_params.rs:92))
- [ ] Add host-side validation comparing GPU vs CPU distances on small graphs
- [ ] Add edge-length variance metric before/after adjust

D. Spatial hashing robustness (Phase 1)
- [ ] Implement dynamic allocation/resizing for cell_start/cell_end buffers in [`UnifiedGPUCompute`](src/utils/unified_gpu_compute.rs:83)
- [ ] Record hashing efficiency and neighbor counts; surface via analytics metrics
- [ ] Add guardrails to prevent pathological grid sizes (caps + warnings)

E. Buffer resizing integration (Phase 1)
- [ ] Invoke [`resize_buffers`](src/utils/unified_gpu_compute.rs:342) from [`update_graph_data_internal`](src/actors/gpu_compute_actor.rs:331) on node/edge count changes
- [ ] Preserve CSR edge data on resize; add tests for no data loss

F. Stress majorization safe enablement (Phase 1)
- [ ] Schedule and clamp outputs in actor; tune interval via [`AdvancedParams`](src/models/constraints.rs:144)
- [ ] Add regression tests (5-run stability; displacement and residual thresholds)

G. GPU clustering MVP (Phase 2)
- [ ] Add K-means device buffers (centroids, assignments, reductions) in [`UnifiedGPUCompute`](src/utils/unified_gpu_compute.rs:83)
- [ ] Implement kernels in [`visionflow_unified.cu`](src/utils/visionflow_unified.cu:1)

J. Observability and auto-balance (Phase 3)
- [ ] Add per-kernel timing and device memory metrics; surface via [`get_performance_stats`](src/handlers/api_handler/analytics/mod.rs:523) and [`get_gpu_metrics`](src/handlers/api_handler/analytics/mod.rs:645)
- [ ] Compute hashing efficiency, kinetic energy on-device and report periodically
- [ ] Use metrics to adapt physics parameters in [`GraphServiceActor`](src/actors/graph_actor.rs:1) update loop

K. CI/build and guardrails (Phase 0/3)
- [ ] Add GPU-enabled CI workflow (NVCC toolchain, driver/container runtime)

L. Deprecation and cleanup (Phase 4)
- [ ] Remove mocks/fallbacks in analytics once GPU parity achieved
- [ ] Consider deprecating [`visual_analytics.rs`](src/gpu/visual_analytics.rs:1) if Path A suffices
- [ ] Remove stale TODOs and update docs

Open issues and mismatches previously claimed as “done”
- Stress majorization is not enabled; actor still contains a placeholder.
- Spatial grid cell buffers are fixed-size; dynamic resizing remains to be implemented.
- Buffer resizing is not invoked from the actor; only core function exists.
- Clustering/anomaly endpoints are simulated; no GPU kernels implemented yet.
- CI GPU smoke execution is not yet configured.

Success metrics (unchanged but reiterated)
- No CPU fallbacks remain for analytics; all GPU.
- PTX cold start stable; CI smoke green; startup < 3s.
- Clustering ARI/NMI within 2–5% of CPU baselines on small graphs; 10–50× speedup at scale.
- Anomaly AUC ≥ 0.85 on synthetic tests; deterministic with seed.
- Steady-state frame time within target; no “device kernel image is invalid” in normal runs.
- Memory growth linear and within projections; no leaks.
