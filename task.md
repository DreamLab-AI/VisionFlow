The visualization component, BotsVisualizationEnhanced.tsx, further clarifies these types by grouping them into two logical categories: Primary Agent Roles (generally rendered in shades of green) and Meta/Coordinating Roles (rendered in shades of gold and yellow).
Here is the complete list, categorized as the system implements it:
Meta & Coordinating Roles (Gold/Yellow Palette)
These agents are typically responsible for orchestration, analysis, and high-level strategy within the bots.
coordinator: The central orchestrator or manager of a task or sub-bots.
analyst: Responsible for analyzing data, performance, or results.
architect: Designs the overall structure or approach for a task.
optimizer: Focuses on improving the efficiency or output of other agents.
monitor: Observes the state of the bots and reports on its health and progress.
Primary Agent Roles (Green Palette)
These agents are the primary "workers" that perform the core tasks assigned to the bots.
coder: Writes or generates code.
tester: Tests and validates the output of other agents, particularly coders.
researcher: Gathers information and performs research tasks.
reviewer: Reviews code or content for quality, correctness, and adherence to standards.
documenter: Writes documentation for the work being done.
specialist: A general-purpose agent with a specific, specialized skill set not covered by other types.
