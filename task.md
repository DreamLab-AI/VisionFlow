use a hive mind to update and validate ext/docs/diagrams.md

split the file up using a queen co-ordinator into individual markdown files for each diagram then assign suitable agents to validate and update each isolated diagram. when ALL agents confirm that they have fully captured all the detail and nuance for their section the files should be recombined into a single de-duplicated and up-to-date diagram compendium markdown with clear structure and navigation. maintains the exceptional granular detail. Highlight and elements of the code that are partially implemented in the relevant section. use a QA agent to check that diagrams exist in the final markdown then delete the working file created for the sub agent.
