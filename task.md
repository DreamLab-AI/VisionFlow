# VisionFlow Quest 3 XR Migration Plan

## Project Overview

**Objective**: Migrate VisionFlow's XR implementation to use Vircadia multi-user platform for Quest 3, detected at client initialization.

**Current State**:
- Babylon.js WebXR single-user implementation (`/ext/client/src/immersive/`)
- Quest 3 auto-detection at app startup (`quest3AutoDetector.ts`)
- Standalone AR passthrough mode with hand tracking and controllers
- No multi-user capabilities

**Target State**:
- Vircadia-powered multi-user XR platform for Quest 3
- Persistent sessions with avatar synchronization
- Spatial audio and real-time entity updates
- Seamless integration with existing VisionFlow graph visualization
