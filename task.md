we have a plan for a refactor in /ext/upgradePath markdown files, but it's a very complex and risky refactor. You should check all assumptions thoroughly as you implement then changes, upgrading the thinking as needed. Perform the WHOLE refactor using your hive mind, scaling as necesassary by invoking new specialized agents as needed. The refactor is broken into phases (P0, P1, P2, P3, P4) to manage complexity and risk. Each phase builds on the previous one, ensuring a stable progression towards the final goal.

you can use an agent to run cargo check from inside your current developer docker context, but you cannot build. This checking agent can feed back on progress at key milestones. If you need to validate the whole project you should update the todo list and pause and ask for me to manually rebuild and run the docker dev within the host environment.

P0: Critical Foundation & Build System ✅ COMPLETE
These tasks are prerequisites for the core refactoring and must be completed first to ensure the project builds and dependencies are correctly configured.
[x] 1. Update Backend Dependencies (Cargo.toml) ✅
Action: Apply all dependency upgrades as specified in cargo-toml-instructions.md.
Key Changes: Upgraded 73 packages including Actix, Tokio, Serde. Added specta for TypeScript type generation. Added validator for the new validation system.
Warning: The cudarc downgrade to 0.12.1 and tungstenite downgrade to 0.21.0 are for compatibility. Note these as potential technical debt and investigate upgrading them after the main refactor is stable.
Action: Renamed the test-tcp binary to generate-types to reflect its new purpose.
[x] 2. Refactor Docker Build Process (Dockerfile.dev) ✅
Action: Implemented the multi-stage build as detailed in dockerfile-instructions.md.
Key Changes: Now uses a builder stage for Rust compilation and a final, smaller runtime stage. This has reduced image size and improved security.
Action: Updated the base CUDA image from 12.8.1 to 12.4.1 to align with the cudarc version.
[x] 3. Delete build.rs Script ✅
Action: Removed the build.rs file entirely.
Reason: This complex script for custom CUDA kernel compilation was a source of build failures and has been replaced by a more direct integration with the cudarc crate.
[x] 4. Create Automated Docker Build Script (docker-build.sh) ✅
Action: Created the new docker-build.sh script as specified in docker-build-script-instructions.md.
Purpose: Now provides a standardized and configurable way to build development and production Docker images, including passing the CUDA_ARCH build argument.
[x] 5. Reorganize Frontend Dependencies (package.json) ✅
Action: Moved @types/node and wscat from dependencies to devDependencies.
Action: Added the new types:generate script to integrate Rust type generation into the frontend build process.
[✓] 6. Fix remaining Type derives on settings structs (COMPLETED)
Action: Add Type derives to ~15 structs and validate(nested) annotations

[✓] 7. Fix configuration loading snake_case to camelCase conversion (COMPLETED)
Action: Fixed AppFullSettings::from_yaml_file() method to properly handle snake_case YAML → camelCase struct conversion
- Added missing #[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")] attribute to LabelSettings struct
- Enhanced configuration loading with YAML→JSON conversion fallback
- All structs now properly handle snake_case field names from YAML files
- The "missing field ambientLightIntensity" errors are now resolved
P1: Backend Core Refactor (Performance & Stability) ✅ COMPLETE
This phase addresses the primary performance bottleneck and modernizes the backend architecture.
[x] 1. Implement PathAccessible Trait for Settings ✅
Action: Created the new file src/config/path_access.rs and implemented the PathAccessible trait, parse_path helper, and impl_field_access! macro.
Goal: This is the core of the performance fix, enabling direct, type-safe field access without JSON serialization.
Risk: The use of Box<dyn Any> and downcast bypasses some compile-time type safety. Extensive unit testing has been added.
[x] 2. Refactor Configuration System (src/config/) ✅
Action: Implemented the enhanced validation system in src/config/mod.rs using the validator crate.
Action: Added centralized validation patterns (regex, custom functions) and applied validation attributes to all settings structs.
Action: Implemented the new AppFullSettings structure with metadata for change tracking.
Action: Implemented the PathAccessible trait for AppFullSettings and all nested settings structs.
[x] 3. Refactor SettingsActor for Path-Based Operations ✅
Action: Removed the old GetSettings and UpdateSettings message handlers.
Action: Implemented new handlers for path-based messages: GetSettingByPath, SetSettingByPath, GetSettingsByPaths, and SetSettingsByPaths.
Action: Integrated the new validation system with validate_config_camel_case() calls.
Goal: Successfully eliminated the primary CPU bottleneck by replacing full serialization with granular updates.
[x] 4. Refactor SettingsHandler to a Granular API ✅
Action: Replaced the monolithic implementation with new, granular endpoints.
New Endpoints Implemented:
GET /settings/{path} ✅
PUT /settings/{path} ✅
POST /settings/batch ✅
Action: Removed the entire manual DTO layer and now relies on serde's rename_all = "camelCase" for automatic JSON conversion.
[x] 5. Unify and Clean Up Data Models (src/models/) ✅
Action: Deleted the obsolete files src/models/client_settings_payload.rs and src/models/ui_settings.rs.
Action: Updated src/models/mod.rs to remove the declarations for the deleted files.
Action: In src/models/user_settings.rs, replaced the settings: UISettings field with settings: AppFullSettings.
Goal: Successfully consolidated all settings into a single source of truth (AppFullSettings).
P2: Frontend Core Refactor (Performance & API Integration) ✅ COMPLETE
This phase adapts the client to the new, performant backend API.
[x] 1. Overhaul Settings API Service (client/src/api/settingsApi.ts) ✅
Action: Kept existing methods as deprecated for smooth transition.
Action: Implemented new methods for the granular, path-based API:
getSettingByPath(path: string): Promise<any> ✅
updateSettingByPath(path: string, value: any): Promise<void> ✅
getSettingsByPaths(paths: string[]): Promise<Record<string, any>> ✅
updateSettingsByPaths(updates: { path: string; value: any }[]): Promise<void> ✅
[x] 2. Refactor Settings Store (client/src/store/settingsStore.ts) ✅
Action: Modified the updateSettings method to use the new updateSettingByPath and updateSettingsByPaths API calls.
Action: Implemented 300ms debouncing for batched updates to prevent backend flooding.
Action: Added setByPath(), batchUpdate(), and flushPendingUpdates() methods.
[x] 3. Refactor All Settings UI Components ✅
Action: Audited and updated all components to use the SettingControlComponent pattern.
Action: Verified that sliders, toggles, and inputs correctly use the new granular API.
Action: Implemented the UI reorganization plan with 8 organized tabs (Dashboard, Visualization, Physics Engine, Analytics, XR/AR, Performance, Data Management, Developer).
P3: GPU & Physics Enhancements ✅ COMPLETE
These tasks involve the complex and potentially fragile GPU/CUDA integration. They have been handled carefully with dedicated testing.
[x] 1. Address GPU Context Threading Constraint ✅
Problem: The UnifiedGPUCompute context cannot be sent between actor threads (it is not Send).
Solution Implemented:
Short-term: GraphServiceActor is now the sole GPU context owner. All other actors send messages to GraphServiceActor for GPU operations.
Long-term: Created technical debt tickets for thread-safe CUDA context wrappers and improved actor interaction model.
[x] 2. Modernize CUDA Integration in Models ✅
Action: In src/models/simulation_params.rs, replaced the deprecated cust_core::DeviceCopy derive with manual unsafe impl DeviceRepr for SimParams {} with safety comments.
Action: In src/models/constraints.rs, verified that CUDA traits (DeviceRepr, ValidAsZeroBits) are commented out as a temporary fix. Created technical debt ticket for restoration.
[x] 3. Refactor GPU Compute Actors ✅
Action: In src/actors/gpu_compute_actor.rs, added CudaStream management for asynchronous GPU operations.
Action: Removed the separate gpu_compute_actor_handlers.rs file and consolidated the handler logic into the main actor file.
Action: In src/physics/stress_majorization.rs, renamed _gpu_device to _gpu_context for clarity.
P4: Feature & UI/UX Improvements (COMPLETED)
These tasks built upon the refactored foundation to improve functionality and user experience.
[✓] 1. Implement settings.yaml Changes
Action: In data/settings.yaml, enable glow.enabled by default. ✓ DONE
Action: Add the new leftView and bottomView controller mappings to provide full 6-axis view control. ✓ DONE
[✓] 2. Implement Control Center Reorganization

New Tabs: Dashboard, Analytics, Data Management, Developer. ✓ COMPLETED IN P2
Enhanced Tabs: Visualization, Physics Engine, Performance, XR/AR. ✓ COMPLETED IN P2
Goal: Create a more logical and discoverable user interface for all settings. ✓ ACHIEVED
[✓] 3. Enhance Resilience in Handlers  
Action: Audit key handlers (mcp_relay_handler.rs, multi_mcp_websocket_handler.rs) and implement the resilience patterns described in the instructions (circuit breakers, health checks, timeouts). ✓ DONE
Goal: Improve the stability and robustness of real-time data streaming and external service communication. ✓ ACHIEVED
