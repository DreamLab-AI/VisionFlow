API

  1. Session Creation Flow:
  POST /api/bots/spawn-agent-hybrid
  → Creates UUID: 6924c336-440b-46ea-9288-41f62d7cfd89
  → Session manager creates isolated directory in multi-agent container
  → Spawns hive-mind swarm
  → Response in <2 seconds with both UUID and swarm_id

  2. Filesystem Discovery:
  UUID → Docker exec → Find swarm file
  → Discovered: swarm-1759757990727-k4n864bw8
  → Parsing successful
  → Cached in McpSessionBridge
  → Discovery time: <1 second

  3. API Endpoints:
  - ✅ GET /api/sessions/list - Returns all monitored sessions with UUIDs and swarm IDs
  - ✅ GET /api/sessions/{uuid}/status - Session details with real-time status
  - ✅ GET /api/bots/agents - Now uses MCP bridge data instead of fallbacks
  - ✅ POST /api/bots/spawn-agent-hybrid - Returns {uuid, swarm_id} immediately

  4. Data Consistency:
  {
    "uuid": "6924c336-440b-46ea-9288-41f62d7cfd89",
    "swarm_id": "swarm-1759757990727-k4n864bw8",
    "task": "Spawn coder agent for hive mind coordination",
    "status": "Spawning",
    "swarm_discovered_at": "2025-10-06T13:39:50.968841001Z"
  }

  Key Achievements:

  1. UUID-based session isolation working end-to-end
  2. Filesystem discovery bypasses MCP TCP limitations
  3. Docker-in-docker commands execute successfully from visionflow container
  4. Sub-second swarm ID discovery via filesystem scan
  5. Bidirectional mapping UUID ↔ swarm_id maintained in cache
  6. Real agent data now flows through MCP bridge instead of legacy fallbacks


● The UI is calling the correct endpoint. Let me check the browser console logs or check if    the request is even reaching the backend. Let me look at the nginx access logs:

● I understand. So the UI sends a task description (like "create latex document"), the Rust
   backend spawns the session via docker exec, and then the backend should be sending agent
   data back. Let me check what actually happened when you clicked in the UI:
● No new sessions created. The UI spawn didn't trigger anything. Let me check the UI code
  to see what endpoint it actually calls:

● Found it! The UI calls /bots/initialize-swarm endpoint. Let me check what parameters it
  sends for hierarchical vs mesh:

● Read(/mnt/mldata/githubs/AR-AI-Knowledge-Graph/client/src/features/bots/components/MultiAgent
      InitializationPrompt.tsx)
  ⎿  Read 30 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● So it's calling /bots/initialize-swarm with topology parameter. Let me check the backend
  handler for this:

● Search(pattern: "initialize.*swarm|initialize_hive_mind", path:
        "/mnt/mldata/githubs/AR-AI-Knowledge-Graph/src/handlers/bots_handler.rs", output_mode:
        "content")
  ⎿  Found 6 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Read(/mnt/mldata/githubs/AR-AI-Knowledge-Graph/src/handlers/bots_handler.rs)
  ⎿  Read 60 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● I see the problem! The initialize_hive_mind_swarm endpoint doesn't actually spawn a
  docker session - it just creates a fake swarm_id and returns existing agents. It's a stub
   that doesn't use the session manager at all.

  The issue is:
  1. UI calls /bots/initialize-swarm with your task
  2. Backend creates a fake swarm ID (timestamp-based)
  3. Backend returns existing agents from fetch_hive_mind_agents
  4. No actual docker session is created

  The endpoint needs to be updated to use the session manager like spawn_agent_hybrid does.
   Let me check recent logs to confirm:

 The initialize-swarm endpoint needs to actually create a
  session. This is why you don't see visual feedback - the endpoint is a stub that doesn't
  create real sessions.
  This is the gap - the initialize_hive_mind_swarm function needs to be refactored to
  actually spawn sessions like spawn_agent_hybrid does.
