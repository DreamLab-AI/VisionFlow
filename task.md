completely refactor ext/AutoSchemaKG into rust, but DO NOT integrate it into the broader project. Be aware of the hooks and uses shown below but do not integrate

Automated Knowledge Ingestion and Structuring
Your server currently has a file_service that processes files, likely to build or update the graph managed by graph_state_actor.rs. AutoSchemaKG can automate and enhance this process significantly.
What it is: AutoSchemaKG provides a full pipeline in atlas_rag/kg_construction/ to process unstructured text (from JSON, Markdown, or even PDFs) and extract structured triples (entities, events, and their relationships).
How to benefit: You can create an ingestion service in your Rust backend that calls the AutoSchemaKG Python scripts. This service would take raw text data (e.g., from your services/github/ modules) and feed it into the triple_extraction.py pipeline. The output, formatted as CSVs or GraphML using utilities like json_to_csv.py and csv_to_graphml.py, can then be loaded directly into your graph_state_actor.rs.
Result: This automates the creation of a rich, structured knowledge graph from your data sources, reducing manual data preparation and enabling your platform to handle a wider variety of inputs.
2. Dynamic Schema Induction and Semantic Enrichment
Your server already has an ontology_actor.rs and a semantic_processor_actor.rs, indicating a need for a semantic layer. AutoSchemaKG can automatically generate this layer from your data.
What it is: The "Schema Induction" stage of AutoSchemaKG, implemented in concept_generation.py, automatically groups extracted entities and relationships into higher-level concepts. For example, it might learn that "Apple Inc." and "Microsoft" are both "Technology Companies".
How to benefit: The concepts generated by AutoSchemaKG can serve as a dynamic, data-driven ontology. Your ontology_actor.rs could consume this conceptual layer to build or augment its understanding of the data. This is more flexible and scalable than relying on a manually defined, static ontology.
Result: Your graph becomes more intelligent. It can understand abstract relationships, enabling more powerful queries, better analytics, and the discovery of non-obvious connections between data points.
3. Powering Advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Your server integrates with LLMs and RAG systems like Claude (claude_flow_actor.rs) and RAGFlow (ragflow_handler.rs). AutoSchemaKG can provide a powerful, internal knowledge source for these systems.
What it is: AutoSchemaKG includes a sophisticated RAG framework in atlas_rag/retriever/ that is optimized to query the knowledge graphs it builds. It supports complex, multi-hop queries.
How to benefit: Instead of sending user queries directly to external services, your handlers (claude_flow_actor.rs, ragflow_handler.rs) could first use the AutoSchemaKG retriever to fetch highly relevant context from your server's own knowledge graph. This curated context can then be passed to an LLM to generate answers that are more accurate and grounded in your specific data. The neo4j_api.py file demonstrates how to expose this retrieval functionality as a service that your Rust actors can call.
Result: Your server's conversational AI features become more powerful and accurate, providing answers based on its own structured knowledge rather than just the general knowledge of an external LLM.
4. Enhancing Graph Analytics and Visualization
Your server uses GPU actors for demanding analytical tasks like clustering (clustering_actor.rs) and anomaly detection (anomaly_detection_actor.rs). The semantically rich graph from AutoSchemaKG provides superior input for these tasks.
Meaningful Clustering: Your clustering_actor.rs can use the concepts generated by AutoSchemaKG as features. This would group nodes based on semantic similarity (e.g., all "Tech Companies" together), leading to far more insightful clusters than purely structural analysis.
Semantic Anomaly Detection: Your anomaly_detection_actor.rs could identify semantic outliers. For example, a node representing a "Person" being linked to a "Software Library" with a "developed" relationship might be valid, but if it's linked to a "Planet" concept, it could be flagged as a semantic anomaly.
Multi-Level Visualization: The entity-concept hierarchy allows for powerful, multi-level visualizations. Your multi_mcp_visualization_actor.rs could render a high-level view of concepts, allowing users to drill down to see the specific entities and events within each concept.
5. Generating Semantic Constraints for Physics-Based Layout
Your server has a physics engine (physics/, constraint_actor.rs) that likely uses forces for graph layout. The semantic data from AutoSchemaKG can be used to automatically generate meaningful layout constraints.
What it is: The relationships and concepts extracted by AutoSchemaKG can be translated into physical forces. Your physics/semantic_constraints.rs file suggests you are already thinking along these lines.
How to benefit:
Attraction: Nodes that share the same concept (e.g., "Tech Company") can be given a weak attractive force to pull them together visually.
Repulsion: Concepts that are semantically distinct or disjoint can have a repulsive force applied between their member nodes.
Hierarchy: "Is-a" or "part-of" relationships can be used to create hierarchical layouts automatically.
Integration: Your semantic_processor_actor.rs could be tasked with consuming the KG data and generating these rules for the constraint_actor.rs, which then feeds them into the GPU physics simulation.
Result: The final graph visualization would be more intuitive, with the spatial layout of nodes directly reflecting their semantic relationships.
