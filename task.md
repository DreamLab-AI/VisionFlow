We have mounted a project in ext/ which is a client server app called

a450d9c90752   ar-ai-knowledge-graph-webxr-dev                               "./dev-entrypoint.sh"    20 hours ago    Up About an hour          4000/tcp, 5173/tcp, 0.0.0.0:3001->3001/tcp, [::]:3001->3001/tcp, 24678/tcp

and we are working using our agentic coding tools to make it work.

CRUCIALLY we are running INSIDE THE multi-agent-container and exposing an MCP service on port 9500 which uses TCP for speed. You have confirmed this is running.

I must start the external docker service for the AR AI Knowledge Graph WebXR Dev server. You cannot do so. You can run cargo check when we work on the rust code. The client is npm dev vite server and is mounted by the external docker container. You can modify the code and it will hot reload. You can also run npm test.

I can use curl commands and similar outside of the docker to test ports, but you cannot.

You have sudo if you need it but should report back before using it.

We are working to connect the client to the agentic container that WE ARE WORKING INSIDE live. The client code does NOT connect directly to the multi-agent-container. It connects via a backend server that we run in an external docker container. Currently the control center in the client says:

VisionFlow (MOCK)
No active multi-agent
Initialize multi-agent

If I click initialize multi-agent it tries to connect to the multi-agent-container but fails. We need to make it work. The failure could be anywhere in the chain. We should first examine the client code to see how it tries to connect. Then we can check the backend server code. Finally we can check the visionflow to multi-agent-container MCP service connection. The flow is that the back end rust code intantiates the swarm in this container and connects to it via MCP, over tcp, then receives data back, uses the force directed graph library to make a graph, then sends that to the client via REST and updates via websocket.

This should be partially documented in the ext/docs but they are likely out of date and we should not rely on them, or even use them as a first source of knowledge. They may be useful if you get stuck.

This will require a full hive mind with the queen ensuring that the architecture is conformant with existing structures and code.

start by spawning agents to examine the client code in ext/client and find how it tries to connect to the multi-agent-container. The word MOCK makes me think it is not trying to connect at all yet. We need to find where that is set and how to make it not MOCK but real.
