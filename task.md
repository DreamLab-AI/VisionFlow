**Critical Note**: These mock implementations are not dead code but incomplete features that users expect to work. They represent technical debt that needs immediate attention to prevent user confusion and maintain product quality.

An analysis of the provided codebase reveals several instances of dead code and duplication, likely resulting from refactoring and evolving requirements. Here is a summary of the findings:

### Dead Code

Dead code consists of files, functions, or code blocks that are no longer used, are unreachable, or serve no functional purpose.

1.  **Old Health Handlers**
    *   **Files:**
        *   `src/handlers/health_handler_old.rs`
        *   `src/handlers/mcp_health_handler_old.rs`
    *   **Reasoning:** The `_old` suffix and the presence of `consolidated_health_handler.rs` and `hybrid_health_handler.rs` strongly indicate these files are obsolete and have been replaced. They are not referenced in the `handlers/mod.rs` file that matters (`api_handler/mod.rs` doesn't list them, and the root `handlers/mod.rs` does not list them either).

2.  **Unused `OptimizedSettingsActor`**
    *   **File:** `src/actors/optimized_settings_actor.rs`
    *   **Reasoning:** The `app_state.rs` file, which is responsible for initializing and holding the application's actor addresses, exclusively instantiates `SettingsActor`. The `OptimizedSettingsActor`, while more complex (featuring Redis, LRU caching, etc.), is never used in the main application flow. Its only apparent use is in `performance/settings_benchmark.rs` for comparison, making it dead code in the context of the main application.

3.  **Unused GPU Utility (`DynamicBufferManager`)**
    *   **File:** `src/gpu/dynamic_buffer_manager.rs`
    *   **Reasoning:** This file provides a generic manager for dynamically resizing GPU buffers. However, the primary GPU compute engine, `src/utils/unified_gpu_compute.rs`, implements its own specific buffer resizing logic (e.g., `resize_buffers`, `resize_cell_buffers`). The generic manager appears to be an unused or abandoned utility.

4.  **Dead Message Handlers in `ForceComputeActor`**
    *   **File:** `src/actors/gpu/force_compute_actor.rs`
    *   **Reasoning:** This actor implements handlers for numerous messages that are outside its scope (e.g., `RunCommunityDetection`, `UpdateConstraints`, `TriggerStressMajorization`). These handlers simply return an error message stating that another actor should handle the request. Since the `GPUManagerActor` correctly routes these messages to the specialized actors, these handlers in `ForceComputeActor` are unreachable in any successful execution path and represent dead code from a likely refactoring.

5.  **Disabled and Obsolete Code in `GraphServiceActor`**
    *   **File:** `src/actors/graph_actor.rs`
    *   **Reasoning:**
        *   The functions `execute_stress_majorization_step` and `update_dynamic_constraints` are explicitly marked with `DISABLED` comments, indicating they are no longer in use.
        *   The large block of code within `update_node_positions` that performs auto-balancing, equilibrium checks, and position clamping is a CPU-based physics implementation. Since the application now delegates physics to the GPU via `ForceComputeActor`, this logic is redundant and effectively dead.
        *   The `#[cfg(test)]` block at the end of the file contains an outdated `new()` function for the actor that doesn't match the current implementation, making it dead test code.

6.  **Obsolete Test Binaries**
    *   **Files:**
        *   `src/test_constraint_integration.rs`
        *   `src/test_metadata_debug.rs`
    *   **Reasoning:** These files appear to be one-off debugging scripts rather than part of a formal test suite. They use outdated actor APIs (e.g., `GraphServiceActor::new_test_instance()`, which is also dead code) and are not integrated into a larger testing framework.

### Duplicates

Duplicate code consists of repeated logic, data structures, or functionality that could be consolidated into a single, reusable component.

1.  **Agent Data Models**
    *   **Files:**
        *   `src/services/agent_visualization_protocol.rs` (defines `MultiMcpAgentStatus`, `AgentPerformanceData`)
        *   `src/types/claude_flow.rs` (defines `AgentStatus`, `PerformanceMetrics`)
    *   **Reasoning:** These two files define nearly identical data structures for representing the status and metrics of an agent. Fields like `cpu_usage`, `memory_usage`, `tasks_completed`, and `success_rate` are duplicated. This creates confusion and maintenance overhead. A single canonical `AgentStatus` model should be defined and used throughout the application.

2.  **Docker Command Execution Logic**
    *   **Files:**
        *   `src/utils/docker_hive_mind.rs`
        *   `src/utils/consolidated_docker_service.rs`
    *   **Reasoning:** `docker_hive_mind.rs` contains logic to build and execute `docker exec` commands. This functionality is provided in a more generic, robust, and reusable way by `consolidated_docker_service.rs`. The command execution logic in `docker_hive_mind.rs` is a direct duplication and should be refactored to use `ConsolidatedDockerService`.

3.  **MCP TCP Clients**
    *   **Files:**
        *   `src/utils/mcp_connection.rs`
        *   `src/utils/mcp_tcp_client.rs`
    *   **Reasoning:** Both files implement TCP clients for communicating with MCP servers. `mcp_connection.rs` provides a stateful, persistent connection, while `mcp_tcp_client.rs` offers a more stateless, request-response client. While their internal approaches differ slightly, they solve the same core problem and represent a significant duplication of functionality that should be unified into a single, robust MCP client module.

4.  **Health Check Handlers**
    *   **Files:**
        *   `src/handlers/consolidated_health_handler.rs`
        *   `src/handlers/hybrid_health_handler.rs`
    *   **Reasoning:** Both handlers provide endpoints for checking system health. `consolidated_health_handler.rs` checks system metrics (CPU, memory) and service actors, while `hybrid_health_handler.rs` focuses on the health of the Docker and MCP systems. Their responsibilities overlap, and the logic for checking system resources and services could be consolidated.

5.  **Two `gpu` Directories with Overlapping Concerns**
    *   **Directories:** `src/gpu/` and `src/actors/gpu/`
    *   **Reasoning:** The existence of two `gpu` directories indicates a refactoring from a monolithic approach to a more modular, actor-based system.
        *   The `src/actors/gpu/` directory contains the modern, integrated actor system.
        *   The `src/gpu/` directory contains older or alternative implementations. For example, `RenderData` is defined in both `gpu/visual_analytics.rs` and `gpu/streaming_pipeline.rs`, which is a direct duplication. Much of the code in `src/gpu/` is likely legacy or superseded by the `unified_gpu_compute.rs` engine used by the actors.

6.  **Analytics API Structure**
    *   **Files:**
        *   `src/handlers/api_handler/analytics/clustering.rs`
        *   `src/handlers/api_handler/analytics/community.rs`
    *   **Reasoning:** Community detection is a form of clustering. Splitting this functionality across two separate files and API endpoints (`/clustering` and `/community`) leads to duplicated request/response structures and a confusing API. This should be consolidated under a single `/analytics/clustering` endpoint.

7.  **Logging Initialization**
    *   **Files:** `src/utils/logging.rs` and `src/utils/advanced_logging.rs`
    *   **Reasoning:** `main.rs` initializes both the simple `env_logger` from `logging.rs` and the more complex structured logger from `advanced_logging.rs`. This is redundant. A single logging strategy should be chosen and used consistently.
