# Development Setup Changes

## What Was Changed

### 1. Docker Compose Updates (`docker-compose.dev.yml`)
- Added Docker socket mount for controlled container access
- Added supervisord configuration mount
- Added dev-exec-proxy script mount

### 2. Dockerfile Updates (`Dockerfile.dev`)
- Added `docker.io` package for Docker CLI inside container
- Added `supervisor` for better service management

### 3. New Scripts Created

#### `/scripts/dev-exec-proxy.sh`
- Secure proxy for Docker exec commands
- Whitelists safe commands (ps, ls, cat, etc.)
- Logs all access attempts to `/app/logs/docker-exec.log`
- Mounted at `/usr/local/bin/dev-exec` in container

#### `/scripts/container-helper.sh`
- User-friendly interface for container management
- Commands: status, logs, restart, shell, test, fix-blank
- Makes it easy to debug and manage services

### 4. Supervisord Configuration (`supervisord.dev.conf`)
- Manages all three services (Rust, Vite, Nginx)
- Automatic restart on failure
- Centralized logging
- Easy service control via `supervisorctl`

### 5. Updated Entrypoint (`scripts/dev-entrypoint.sh`)
- Added Docker group setup for socket access
- Added supervisord support
- Falls back to original method if supervisord not available

## How to Use

1. **Start the development environment:**
   ```bash
   cd /workspace/ext
   ./scripts/dev.sh
   ```

2. **Once running, use the helper script:**
   ```bash
   # Check status
   ./scripts/container-helper.sh status
   
   # View logs
   ./scripts/container-helper.sh logs vite
   
   # Restart services
   ./scripts/container-helper.sh restart all
   
   # Enter container
   ./scripts/container-helper.sh shell
   
   # Fix blank page
   ./scripts/container-helper.sh fix-blank
   ```

3. **From inside this environment, you can now:**
   ```bash
   # Use the secure exec proxy
   /usr/local/bin/dev-exec status
   /usr/local/bin/dev-exec exec ps aux
   /usr/local/bin/dev-exec logs
   ```

## Security Notes

- Docker socket is mounted read-only
- Exec proxy only allows whitelisted commands
- All exec attempts are logged
- Container access limited to the development container only

## Next Steps

After restarting with these changes:
1. Services will be managed by supervisord
2. You'll have controlled Docker access from within the dev environment
3. The blank page issue can be debugged and fixed
4. We can implement the swarm visualization as per task.md
