# Settings.yaml Fixes Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue 1: Incorrect Indentation (First Error)
**Error:** "mapping values are not allowed in this context at byte 3306 line 112"

**Cause:** Lines 112-121 and 224-233 had incorrect indentation (10 spaces instead of 8)

**Fixed:** Corrected indentation for these parameters:
- repulsion_cutoff_min
- repulsion_cutoff_max  
- repulsion_softening_min
- repulsion_softening_max
- center_gravity_min
- center_gravity_max
- spatial_hash_efficiency_threshold
- cluster_density_threshold
- numerical_instability_threshold

### Issue 2: Duplicate Keys (Second Error)
**Error:** "duplicated key in mapping at byte 4430 line 147"

**Cause:** The following parameters were defined twice in the same physics sections:
- `repulsion_softening_epsilon` (lines 104 and 147, lines 213 and 256)
- `center_gravity_k` (lines 105 and 148, lines 214 and 257)
- `grid_cell_size` (lines 106 and 149, lines 215 and 258)

**Fixed:** Removed duplicate entries at:
- Lines 147-149 (first physics section)
- Lines 256-258 (second physics section)

## How to Apply the Fix

Since the container is using the old settings.yaml, you need to either:

1. **Copy the fixed file to the running container:**
   ```bash
   docker cp data/settings.yaml visionflow_container:/app/settings.yaml
   docker restart visionflow_container
   ```

2. **Or restart with the fixed file:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/launch.sh restart
   ```

## Validation

The YAML file has been validated and is now properly formatted with no syntax errors or duplicate keys.

## Result

The Rust backend should now start successfully without YAML parsing errors.
