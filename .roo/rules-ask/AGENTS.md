# Project Documentation Rules (Non-Obvious Only)

- **Agent Rules**: `CLAUDE.md` contains critical behavior rules (Swarm, spawn-and-wait) that override generic instructions.
- **Architecture**: `docs/architecture/` is the source of truth for system design (Hexagonal, Ports/Adapters status).
- **Aliases**: `multi-agent-docker/unified-config/turbo-flow-aliases.sh` defines the extensive CLI alias system used in the container.
