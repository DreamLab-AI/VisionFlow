# Voice-to-Swarm Integration Complete Implementation Summary

## Date: 2025-09-07

## âœ… Implementation Complete

Successfully integrated voice commands with the swarm orchestration system, leveraging existing client and server infrastructure.

## What Was Discovered and Integrated

### Existing Infrastructure Found:
1. **Client-Side (Already Complete!)**:
   - `VoiceWebSocketService.ts` - Full WebSocket voice handling
   - `AudioInputService.ts` - Microphone capture with MediaRecorder
   - `AudioOutputService.ts` - TTS audio playback
   - `VoiceButton.tsx` - UI component with auth gating
   - `useVoiceInteraction.ts` - React hook for voice
   - Audio processor worker for Web Audio API

2. **Server-Side (Already Complete!)**:
   - `SpeechService` - Orchestrates STT/TTS with Whisper/Kokoro
   - `SpeechSocket` - WebSocket handler for audio streaming
   - Binary audio chunk processing
   - Broadcast channels for multi-client support

3. **Network Services Confirmed**:
   - Whisper STT: `172.18.0.5:8000` âœ… (reachable)
   - Kokoro TTS: `172.18.0.9:8880` âœ… (reachable)

## What We Added

### 1. Voice Command System (`/src/actors/voice_commands.rs`)
```rust
pub struct VoiceCommand {
    pub raw_text: String,
    pub parsed_intent: SwarmIntent,
    pub context: Option<ConversationContext>,
    pub respond_via_voice: bool,
    pub session_id: String,
}

pub struct VoicePreamble;  // Compact preamble system
```

### 2. Voice Preamble System
Every swarm instruction gets:
```
[VOICE_MODE: Reply in 1-2 short sentences. Be conversational. No special chars.]
```

### 3. Supervisor Voice Handler (`/src/actors/supervisor_voice.rs`)
- Handles voice commands in SupervisorActor
- Wraps all instructions with voice preamble
- Routes to swarm with voice constraints

### 4. SpeechService Integration
Modified `process_audio_chunk` to:
1. Receive audio from WebSocket
2. Send to Whisper (172.18.0.5:8000)
3. Parse transcription for commands
4. Route to SupervisorActor
5. Generate TTS response
6. Send to Kokoro (172.18.0.9:8880)

## Architecture Flow

```

## Supported Voice Commands

- "Spawn a researcher agent"
- "List all agents"
- "What's the status?"
- "Add a node called analytics"
- "Stop the coder agent"
- "Help"

## Key Files Modified/Created

### New Files:
- `/workspace/ext/src/actors/voice_commands.rs` - Command parsing
- `/workspace/ext/src/actors/supervisor_voice.rs` - Handler implementation
- `/workspace/ext/src/services/speech_voice_integration.rs` - Integration trait

### Modified Files:
- `/workspace/ext/src/actors/mod.rs` - Added voice modules
- `/workspace/ext/src/services/speech_service.rs` - Integrated voice command processing

### Existing Files (No Changes Needed):
- Client voice components (already complete!)
- WebSocket handlers (already set up!)
- Audio services (fully functional!)

## Testing the System

### 1. Voice Button Access
- Located in MainLayout.tsx
- Protected by AuthGatedVoiceButton
- Requires Nostr authentication (or disable auth)

### 2. Test Commands
```javascript
// In browser console
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:9998/ws/speech');

// Send test command (would normally be audio)
ws.send(new Blob(['spawn a researcher agent']));

// Listen for responses
ws.onmessage = (e) => {
    if (e.data instanceof Blob) {
        // Play TTS audio
    } else {
        console.log('Transcription:', e.data);
    }
};
```

### 3. Manual API Tests
```bash
# Test Whisper
curl -X POST http://172.18.0.5:8000/transcription/ \
  -F "file=@test.wav"

# Test Kokoro (would need proper format)
curl -X POST http://172.18.0.9:8880/v1/audio/speech \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input":"Test speech"}'
```

## System Status

### âœ… Complete:
- Voice command parsing with NLP
- Preamble system for voice-appropriate responses
- Integration with existing audio infrastructure
- WebSocket binary audio handling
- STT/TTS service connectivity
- Supervisor actor voice handling

### ðŸŽ¯ Ready for Testing:
- Browser microphone â†’ Whisper STT
- Command parsing â†’ Swarm execution
- Response generation â†’ Kokoro TTS
- Audio playback in browser

### ðŸ“Š Performance Expectations:
- STT latency: ~1-2 seconds
- Command processing: < 500ms
- TTS generation: ~1-2 seconds
- Total round-trip: ~3-5 seconds

## No Parallel Systems!

We successfully integrated with:
- âœ… Existing VoiceWebSocketService
- âœ… Existing AudioInputService
- âœ… Existing SpeechService
- âœ… Existing WebSocket handlers

No duplicate systems were created. All voice functionality flows through the existing, well-architected infrastructure.

## Next Steps

1. **Enable Voice Button**: Ensure auth is configured or disabled
2. **Test Audio Flow**: Use browser to test microphone capture
3. **Verify Commands**: Test "spawn agent" commands
4. **Fine-tune NLP**: Adjust command keywords as needed

## Conclusion

The voice-to-swarm integration is complete and ready for testing. The system leverages all existing infrastructure without creating parallel systems. Voice commands will be automatically wrapped with preambles to ensure swarm responses are voice-appropriate.
