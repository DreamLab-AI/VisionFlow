# IRIS Infographic Prompt: The Supercake

**Project**: Hero Infographic for IRIS (Intelligent Realtime Integrated Studio)
**Target Audience**: Creative Technologists, Technical Artists, AI-Native Creators
**Resolution**: 4K (3840x2160) or higher, suitable for print at 300 DPI
**Style**: Modern tech meets artisanal bakery, sophisticated humor, premium feel

## Visual Concept

### Overall Composition

**Layout**: Vertical split composition
- **Left side (40%)**: "The Industry" - A sterile, corporate bakery counter displaying sad, identical cake slices under harsh fluorescent lighting
- **Right side (60%)**: "IRIS" - A magnificent, multi-layered supercake in a warm, artisanal setting with dramatic lighting

**Color Palette**:
- Left (Industry): Cold blues, sterile whites, corporate grays (#E5E7EB, #6B7280, #94A3B8)
- Right (IRIS): Warm ambers, rich purples, glowing golds (#F59E0B, #7C3AED, #FCD34D, #1F2937)
- Accent: Electric teal for technical callouts (#06B6D4)

**Typography**:
- Headlines: Modern geometric sans-serif (like "Clash Display" or "Space Grotesk")
- Body: Clean technical sans (like "Inter" or "IBM Plex Sans")
- Labels: Monospace for technical specs (like "JetBrains Mono")
