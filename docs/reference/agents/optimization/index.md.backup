# Optimisation Agents

This section contains documentation for agents focused on performance optimisation and system efficiency.

## Contents

### Core Optimisation Agents
- **[benchmark-suite.md](benchmark-suite.md)** - Comprehensive benchmarking and performance testing
- **[load-balancer.md](load-balancer.md)** - Dynamic load balancing and resource distribution
- **[performance-monitor.md](performance-monitor.md)** - Real-time performance monitoring and analysis
- **[resource-allocator.md](resource-allocator.md)** - Intelligent resource allocation and management
- **[topology-optimizer.md](topology-optimizer.md)** - Network and system topology optimisation

## Purpose

Optimisation agents focus on maximising system performance through:

- Real-time performance monitoring and alerting
- Intelligent resource allocation and management
- Load balancing and traffic distribution
- System topology analysis and improvement
- Benchmarking and performance testing

## Agent Categories

### Monitoring Agents
Agents that observe system behaviour and identify performance bottlenecks.

### Allocation Agents
Agents that optimise resource distribution and utilisation.

### Analysis Agents
Agents that analyse system architecture and suggest improvements.

### Testing Agents
Agents that conduct performance tests and benchmarking.

## Target Use Cases

- High-availability system management
- Performance-critical application optimisation
- Resource-constrained environment management
- Scalability planning and testing
