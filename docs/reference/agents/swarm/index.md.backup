# Swarm Coordination Agents

This section contains documentation for agents that implement swarm intelligence and coordination patterns.

## Contents

### Core Swarm Agents
- **[adaptive-coordinator.md](adaptive-coordinator.md)** - Dynamic coordination that adapts to changing conditions
- **[hierarchical-coordinator.md](hierarchical-coordinator.md)** - Tree-structured coordination with clear command hierarchy
- **[mesh-coordinator.md](mesh-coordinator.md)** - Peer-to-peer coordination with full connectivity

## Purpose

Swarm coordination agents implement different patterns of multi-agent coordination:

- **Adaptive Coordination**: Dynamic adjustment to changing conditions and requirements
- **Hierarchical Coordination**: Structured command and control with clear leadership
- **Mesh Coordination**: Decentralised peer-to-peer coordination and decision making

## Coordination Patterns

### Adaptive Coordination
Automatically adjusts coordination strategies based on:
- Task complexity and requirements
- Agent availability and capabilities
- System performance and efficiency
- Environmental conditions

### Hierarchical Coordination
Implements tree-structured coordination with:
- Clear command hierarchy
- Centralised decision making
- Structured task delegation
- Efficient resource allocation

### Mesh Coordination
Provides peer-to-peer coordination featuring:
- Decentralised decision making
- Full connectivity between agents
- Robust fault tolerance
- Democratic consensus building

## Use Cases

### Adaptive Coordination
- Dynamic environments with changing requirements
- Variable workloads and resource availability
- Learning and optimisation scenarios
- Self-organising systems

### Hierarchical Coordination
- Large-scale projects with clear structure
- Mission-critical systems requiring control
- Complex workflows with dependencies
- Enterprise environments

### Mesh Coordination
- Highly distributed systems
- Fault-tolerant applications
- Collaborative development environments
- Democratic decision-making processes
