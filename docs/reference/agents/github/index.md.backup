## Purpose

These agents provide comprehensive GitHub integration capabilities including:

- Automated code review and quality assessment
- Issue and project management
- Release coordination and deployment
- Multi-repository synchronisation
- Workflow automation and CI/CD integration

## Agent Categories

### Individual Agents
Single-purpose agents focused on specific GitHub operations.

### Swarm Agents  
Coordinated multi-agent systems for complex GitHub workflows.

### Integration Agents
Agents that connect GitHub with other systems and services.
