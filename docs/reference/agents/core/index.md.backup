# Core Agents

This section contains documentation for the fundamental agents that provide essential development and workflow capabilities.

## Contents

### Development Agents
- **[coder.md](coder.md)** - Code generation, implementation, and programming tasks
- **[reviewer.md](reviewer.md)** - Code review, quality assessment, and improvement suggestions
- **[tester.md](tester.md)** - Test creation, validation, and quality assurance

### Planning and Research Agents  
- **[planner.md](planner.md)** - Project planning, task breakdown, and workflow coordination
- **[researcher.md](researcher.md)** - Information gathering, analysis, and research tasks

## Purpose

Core agents provide the fundamental capabilities required for software development workflows:

- **Code Implementation**: Writing, generating, and maintaining code
- **Quality Assurance**: Reviewing, testing, and validating code quality
- **Project Planning**: Breaking down tasks and coordinating workflows
- **Research**: Gathering information and analysing requirements

## Agent Roles

### Coder Agent
Specialises in implementing solutions, writing code, and translating requirements into working software.

### Reviewer Agent  
Focuses on code quality, best practices, security considerations, and improvement recommendations.

### Tester Agent
Creates comprehensive test suites, validates functionality, and ensures quality standards.

### Planner Agent
Coordinates project workflows, breaks down complex tasks, and manages dependencies.

### Researcher Agent
Gathers information, analyses requirements, and provides insights for decision making.

## Collaboration Patterns

Core agents work together in standard software development patterns:

- **Research → Plan → Code → Review → Test**
- **Iterative refinement** with feedback loops
- **Parallel execution** for independent tasks
- **Coordinated handoffs** between specialised roles

## Target Use Cases

- Standard software development projects
- Code generation and automation
- Quality assurance workflows
- Research and planning phases
- Educational and learning scenarios
