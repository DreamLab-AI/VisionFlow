# WebSocket Connection Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Hardcoded IP Address**: Client was trying to connect to `ws://192.168.0.51:3001/wss` due to a custom backend URL setting
2. **502 Bad Gateway Errors**: API endpoints failing because the hardcoded IP is not accessible
3. **Lost Knowledge Base Visuals**: Connection failures preventing graph data from loading

## Fixes Applied

### 1. WebSocketService.ts Updates

**Enhanced URL Detection**:
- Added development mode detection using `import.meta.env.DEV`
- In development: Uses `window.location` to construct proper WebSocket URL
- In production: Uses relative `/wss` path
- Ignores problematic hardcoded IP addresses (192.168.0.51)

```typescript
// Development mode uses window.location
if (import.meta.env.DEV) {
  const protocol = window.location.protocol === 'https:' ? 'wss:' : 'ws:';
  const host = window.location.hostname;
  const port = window.location.port || '3001';
  const url = `${protocol}//${host}:${port}/wss`;
}
```

### 2. Vite Configuration Updates

**Added Proxy Configuration**:
```typescript
proxy: {
  '/api': {
    target: 'http://localhost:3001',
    changeOrigin: true,
  },
  '/wss': {
    target: 'ws://localhost:3001',
    ws: true,
    changeOrigin: true,
  },
}
```

This ensures that in development, WebSocket and API requests are properly proxied to the backend server.

### 3. Custom Backend URL Filtering

**Ignores Problematic IPs**:
- Added check to ignore custom backend URLs containing '192.168.0.51'
- Falls back to default URL determination when problematic IPs are detected
- Logs warning when ignoring hardcoded IPs

## Expected Results

1. **WebSocket Connection**: Should now connect to the correct URL based on environment
2. **API Requests**: Should properly route through proxy in development
3. **Knowledge Base Visuals**: Should restore once WebSocket connection is established

## Next Steps

1. Clear browser cache and reload the application
2. Check browser console for new WebSocket URL being used
3. Verify backend services are running on port 3001
4. Monitor for successful WebSocket connection messages

## Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Open browser developer console
2. Look for WebSocket connection logs
3. Should see: `Determined WebSocket URL (dev): ws://[current-host]:3001/wss`
4. Connection should establish without 502 errors
5. Knowledge base visualization should load properly

## Additional Notes

- The rust.log shows active MCP connections, indicating backend is operational
- The issue was primarily client-side configuration
- No backend changes were required
- Solution maintains compatibility with both development and production environments
