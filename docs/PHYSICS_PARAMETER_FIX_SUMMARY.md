# Physics Parameter Update Fix - Implementation Summary

## Issue Fixed
The physics parameter updates from the control center were being sent to the dormant `GPUComputeActor` instead of the active `GraphServiceActor` that actually runs the simulation.

## Root Cause
- The `GraphServiceActor` runs the physics simulation using its embedded `UnifiedGPUCompute` instance
- The API handler was incorrectly routing `UpdateSimulationParams` messages to `GPUComputeActor`
- The `GPUComputeActor` would receive and process the updates but sits idle while `GraphServiceActor` continued using stale parameters

## Solution Implemented

### File Modified: `/workspace/ext/src/handlers/api_handler/analytics/mod.rs`

Changed the `update_analytics_params` function to:
1. Send physics parameter updates to `app_state.graph_service_addr` instead of `app_state.gpu_compute_addr`
2. Updated log messages to indicate correct routing to GraphServiceActor

### Key Change (Line 387-401):
```rust
// Send to GraphServiceActor (which is running the actual simulation)
let graph_actor_addr = &app_state.graph_service_addr;

// Send as UpdateSimulationParams to the GraphServiceActor
use crate::actors::messages::UpdateSimulationParams;
match graph_actor_addr.send(UpdateSimulationParams { params: sim_params }).await {
    Ok(Ok(())) => {
        info!("Physics parameters forwarded successfully to GraphServiceActor");
    }
    Ok(Err(e)) => {
        warn!("GraphServiceActor failed to update physics params: {}", e);
    }
    Err(e) => {
        warn!("GraphServiceActor mailbox error: {}", e);
    }
}
```

## Verification Results
✅ **Rust Compilation**: `cargo check` passes successfully with only minor warnings
✅ **PTX Compilation**: CUDA kernel PTX file compiled successfully (97045 bytes)
✅ **Message Handler**: Confirmed `GraphServiceActor` has proper `UpdateSimulationParams` handler implementation

## Expected Behavior After Fix
- Physics parameter changes in the control center will now properly update the active simulation
- Graph behavior will respond to:
  - Repulsion force adjustments
  - Damping changes
  - Time step modifications
  - Attraction strength updates
  - Maximum velocity constraints
  - Temperature settings

## No Breaking Changes
- Maintains backward compatibility with visual analytics parameters
- GraphServiceActor still forwards updates to GPUComputeActor if present
- No changes to message types or actor interfaces

## Testing Recommendations
1. Adjust repulsion parameter in control center - should see immediate effect on node spacing
2. Modify damping - should affect how quickly nodes settle
3. Change time step - should affect simulation speed/stability
4. Test all physics controls to ensure proper responsiveness

## Architecture Note
Consider future refactoring to consolidate physics execution in a single location to prevent similar routing issues. The current dual-actor approach (GPUComputeActor + GraphServiceActor) creates potential for confusion.
