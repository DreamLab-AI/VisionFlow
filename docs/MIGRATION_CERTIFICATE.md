## Critical Issues Preventing Full Certification

### Compilation Status: ‚ùå BLOCKED (0/10)

**Total Errors**: 361 errors
**Total Warnings**: 193 warnings
**Blocking Issue**: hexser v0.4.7 trait implementation mismatch

**Error Breakdown**:
- E0437: `Output` type not member of trait (45 instances)
- E0220: Associated type `Output` not found (44 instances)
- E0277: Unsized type issues (82 instances)
- E0195: Async/sync signature mismatch (23 instances)
- E0046: Missing `validate()` method (23 instances)

**Root Cause**: Code assumes hexser has `Output` associated type, but hexser v0.4.7 does NOT have this type. All 45 CQRS handlers have incorrect trait implementations.

**Fix Complexity**: Medium
**Estimated Fix Time**: 4-6 hours of systematic refactoring

**Required Changes**:
1. Remove all `type Output = ...` declarations (45 handlers)
2. Convert `async fn handle(...)` to sync with `block_on` (45 handlers)
3. Implement `validate()` for all directives (23 types)
4. Fix generic type bounds (replace `dyn Trait` in generics)

**Severity**: üî¥ CRITICAL - Blocks all compilation and deployment
