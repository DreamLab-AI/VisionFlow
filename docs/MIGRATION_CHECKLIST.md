# VisionFlow Dependency Migration Checklist

## Pre-Migration Checklist
- [x] Backup current Cargo.toml and Cargo.lock
- [x] Document all current dependency versions
- [x] Review breaking changes for major version updates
- [x] Check for parking_lot usage (REMOVED - none found)
- [x] Update minimum Rust version requirement

## Dependency Updates Completed
- [x] Actix framework (4.5.1 → 4.9)
- [x] WebSocket libraries (tungstenite 0.22 → 0.24)
- [x] GPU/CUDA support (cudarc 0.11 → 0.12)
- [x] HTTP client (reqwest 0.11 → 0.12)
- [x] Nostr SDK (0.26 → 0.36)
- [x] System utilities (sysinfo, dashmap, glam)
- [x] Math libraries (nalgebra 0.32 → 0.33)
- [x] Configuration (config 0.13 → 0.14)
- [x] Error handling (thiserror 1.0 → 2.0)
- [x] Development dependencies

## Docker Environment Updates
- [x] Update production Dockerfile to CUDA 12.8.1
- [x] Update development Dockerfile to CUDA 12.8.1
- [x] Update Rust installation to latest stable
- [x] Update minimum Rust version to 1.75.0

## Security Improvements
- [x] Remove exact version pinning
- [x] Remove parking_lot dependency completely
- [x] Create security audit script
- [x] Document security improvements

## Documentation Updates
- [x] Create DEPENDENCY_UPDATE_2025.md
- [x] Create migration checklist (this file)
- [x] Create security audit script
- [x] Update build scripts

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Run `cargo build --features cpu --no-default-features`
- [ ] Run `cargo build --features gpu` (requires CUDA)
- [ ] Run `cargo test --all-features`
- [ ] Build production Docker image
- [ ] Build development Docker image
- [ ] Test WebSocket connections
- [ ] Test MCP agent discovery
- [ ] Test GPU physics simulation
- [ ] Performance benchmarking

## Deployment Steps
1. [ ] Review all changes in git diff
2. [ ] Run security audit script
3. [ ] Complete all testing requirements
4. [ ] Build and tag Docker images
5. [ ] Deploy to staging environment
6. [ ] Run integration tests
7. [ ] Monitor for errors/warnings
8. [ ] Deploy to production
9. [ ] Monitor performance metrics

## Rollback Plan
If issues occur:
1. Git revert to previous Cargo.toml
2. Rebuild with previous dependencies
3. Use previous Docker images (tagged)
4. Document issues for future reference

## Post-Migration Tasks
- [ ] Monitor application logs for 24 hours
- [ ] Check performance metrics
- [ ] Review memory usage patterns
- [ ] Document any adjustments needed
- [ ] Schedule next dependency review (Q2 2025)

## Known Issues & Resolutions
- **Issue**: None currently identified
- **Resolution**: N/A

## Performance Metrics to Monitor
- Application startup time
- Memory usage (baseline vs. new)
- CPU utilization
- GPU utilization (if applicable)
- WebSocket connection latency
- HTTP request response times
- Agent discovery cycle time

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities reported
- [ ] Performance metrics within 5% of baseline
- [ ] No runtime errors in 24-hour period
- [ ] MCP agent visualization functioning correctly

## Notes
- Removed parking_lot completely to avoid locking issues
- Using standard library synchronization primitives
- All dependencies updated to latest stable versions
- Security-first approach with no exact version pinning
- Ready for Rust 1.75+ features
