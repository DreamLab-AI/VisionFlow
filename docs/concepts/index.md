# VisionFlow Concepts Documentation

Welcome to the VisionFlow conceptual documentation. This section provides in-depth explanations of the core concepts, architectures, and design patterns that power the VisionFlow VisionFlow system.

## Overview

VisionFlow is a multi-agent coordination platform that combines real-time graph visualisation, GPU-accelerated physics, and distributed AI agent orchestration. The system enables complex knowledge graph interactions through WebXR interfaces while maintaining high performance and scalability.

## Core Concepts

### [System Overview](./01-system-overview.md)
Understand the complete VisionFlow architecture, including the multi-container Docker setup, component interactions, and data flow patterns that enable real-time collaboration between AI agents and human users.

### [Agentic Workers](./02-agentic-workers.md)
Explore the distributed agent system, including the MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration, swarm coordination patterns, and task orchestration mechanisms that enable intelligent multi-agent collaboration.

### [GPU Compute Architecture](./gpu-compute.md)
Learn about the CUDA-accelerated physics engine (40 kernels), hybrid CPU/GPU SSSP algorithms, and the sophisticated force-directed graph layout system that powers real-time visualisation of complex knowledge networks. Includes detailed actor communication flow, performance optimisations, and comprehensive kernel documentation.

### [Networking and Protocols](./04-networking.md)
Dive into the WebSocket infrastructure, binary protocols (34-byte format), and real-time synchronisation mechanisms that enable sub-10ms latency updates and 84.8% bandwidth reduction.

### [Security Architecture](./05-security.md)
Understand the comprehensive security model including authentication, rate limiting, input validation, and deployment best practices that protect the system and its users.

### [Data Flow Patterns](./06-data-flow.md)
Explore how data moves through the system, from agent creation and task execution to real-time visualisation updates and persistent storage.

## Key Architectural Principles

### 1. **Distributed Actor Model**
The system uses Actix actors for concurrent message processing, enabling fault-tolerant, scalable coordination between components.

### 2. **Real-Time Optimisation**
Every component is designed for real-time performance, from 60 FPS graph rendering to 5Hz position updates with binary protocols.

### 3. **Hybrid Architecture**
Combines the best of different technologies: Rust for performance, TypeScript for UI, CUDA for GPU compute, and WebAssembly for portable algorithms.

### 4. **Graceful Degradation**
The system maintains functionality even when components fail, with automatic reconnection, state recovery, and fallback mechanisms.

### 5. **Security by Design**
Security is built into every layer, from JWT authentication to input validation and rate limiting, ensuring safe multi-user operation.

## Getting Started

For practical implementation guides, see our [Getting Started](../getting-started/index.md) documentation. For detailed API references, consult the [Reference](../reference/README.md) section.

## Architecture Evolution

VisionFlow has evolved from a single-actor bottleneck system to a sophisticated multi-swarm orchestration platform. Key improvements include:

- **Connection Stability**: From 1-2ms dropouts to 100% uptime
- **Performance**: 84.8% bandwidth reduction, 77% wire format optimisation
- **Scalability**: From single swarm to 50+ concurrent swarms
- **GPU Utilisation**: Dynamic buffer sizing, stability gates, and efficient force calculations
