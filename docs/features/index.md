# Features Documentation

VisionFlow provides a comprehensive set of features for visualising and interacting with knowledge graphs and AI multi-agent systems. This section details each major feature and how to use it effectively.

## Core Features

### 🎯 Visualisation Features

#### [⚖️ Adaptive Balancing](adaptive-balancing.md)
Intelligent auto-tuning system that automatically adjusts physics parameters to maintain stable graph visualisation. Features multi-metric stability detection, smooth parameter transitions, and real-time feedback.

#### [🌐 WebXR Support](../client/xr-integration.md)
Immersive VR/AR visualisation capabilities with Quest 3 integration, enabling spatial interaction with knowledge graphs in three-dimensional space.

#### [🎨 Visual Effects](visual-effects.md)
Advanced rendering features including bloom effects, holographic nodes, edge flow animations, and customisable visual themes.

### 🤖 AI Integration

#### [Multi-Agent Visualisation](agent-orchestration.md)
Real-time visualisation of AI agent networks with Claude Flow MCP integration, showing agent relationships, token usage, and task execution flow.

#### [🔊 Voice Interaction](../voice-system.md)
Natural language interface for graph manipulation, supporting voice commands for navigation, search, and modification operations.

### 📊 Analytics & Performance

#### [GPU-Accelerated Analytics](analytics.md)
High-performance clustering, anomaly detection, and graph metrics computation using CUDA acceleration.

#### [Real-time Streaming](streaming.md)
Binary WebSocket protocol providing 85% bandwidth reduction with sub-millisecond latency for 60 FPS position updates.

## Feature Interactions

### Adaptive Balancing + GPU Physics
The Adaptive Balancing system works in tandem with the GPU physics engine to:
- Monitor real-time position updates from CUDA kernels
- Adjust force parameters that are applied in the next GPU computation cycle
- Ensure smooth transitions that don't destabilise the physics simulation

### Multi-Agent + Graph Visualisation
AI agents are visualised as a secondary graph layer that:
- Shares the same rendering pipeline but with distinct visual styling
- Can be toggled independently from the knowledge graph
- Shows real-time token usage and task execution

### WebXR + Voice Commands
In VR/AR mode, voice commands provide hands-free interaction:
- "Show connections for node X"
- "Zoom to cluster Y"
- "Enable adaptive balancing"

## Performance Considerations
