## Legacy Documentation

### Identified for Archival

The following documentation references **legacy patterns** that are being replaced:

| Category | Documents | Reason |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| **File-based Config** | References to settings.yaml, dev_config.toml | Replaced by database-backed config |
| **Actor System** | GraphServiceSupervisor, OptimizedSettingsActor docs | Being replaced by hexagonal adapters |
| **Direct DB Access** | Old database access patterns | Replaced by ports/adapters |
| **Client Caching** | Client-side state management docs | Replaced by server-authoritative |
| **Old Endpoints** | References to actor-based API endpoints | Replaced by CQRS handlers |

### Already Archived

- `/docs/_archive/` - Contains legacy documentation
- `/docs/DATABASE_REFACTOR_COMPLETE.md` - Partial refactor (superseded by DATABASE.md)
- `/docs/QUEEN_ARCHITECTURAL_ANALYSIS.md` - Migration analysis (superseded by ARCHITECTURE.md)
