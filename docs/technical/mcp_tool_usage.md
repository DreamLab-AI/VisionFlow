# MCP Tool Integration Analysis

This document provides an analysis of which `powerdev` MCP (Multi-agent Control Plane) tools are currently integrated and utilized by the Rust backend.

## I. Actively Used MCP Tools

These tools are actively called by the `ClaudeFlowActor` and form the core of the current swarm management functionality.

| Category | Tool Name | Implementation Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Swarm Orchestration** | `swarm_init` | Called by the `InitializeSwarm` message handler to configure and start a new agent swarm. |
| | `agent_spawn` | Called by the `SpawnClaudeAgent` and `InitializeSwarm` handlers to create new agents. |
| | `agent_list` | Called by `list_agents` in the client, used for polling agent statuses for visualization. |
| **Neural & Cognitive** | `neural_train` | Called within the `InitializeSwarm` handler when `enable_neural` is true to train coordination patterns. |
| **Performance & Monitoring**| `health_check` | Called periodically by the `ClaudeFlowActor` to monitor the health of the MCP service. |

## II. Implemented but Unused MCP Tools

The `ClaudeFlowClient` has support for the following tools, but they are not currently called by the `ClaudeFlowActor`. They are available for future expansion.

| Category | Tool Name(s) | Client Method(s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Swarm Orchestration** | `swarm_status` | `get_swarm_status()` |
| **Task Management** | `task_orchestrate`, `task_status`, `task_results` | `create_task()`, `list_tasks()`, `orchestrate_task()`, `get_task_status()`, `get_task_results()` |
| **Memory Management** | `memory_usage`, `memory_search` | `store_in_memory()`, `retrieve_from_memory()`, `search_memory()` |
| **Performance & Monitoring**| `performance_report` | `get_performance_report()`, `get_system_metrics()` |
| **Neural & Cognitive** | `neural_predict` | `neural_predict()` |
| **Generic/Meta** | `tools/list`, `commands/execute` | `list_tools()`, `execute_command()` |

## III. Unimplemented MCP Tools

The vast majority of the 87 available tools are not yet implemented in the `ClaudeFlowClient`. Integrating these would require adding new methods to the client and corresponding handlers in the actor.

This includes, but is not limited to:

*   **Advanced Swarm Orchestration**: `topology_optimize`, `load_balance`, `coordination_sync`, etc.
*   **Advanced Neural & Cognitive**: `pattern_recognize`, `cognitive_analyze`, `transfer_learn`, etc.
*   **GitHub Integration**: `github_repo_analyze`, `github_pr_manage`, etc.
*   **Dynamic Agent Architecture (DAA)**: `daa_agent_create`, `daa_capability_match`, etc.
*   **System & Security**: `security_scan`, `backup_create`, etc.

This analysis shows that the current integration provides a solid foundation for agent and swarm lifecycle management, with significant opportunities for expansion into the more advanced capabilities offered by the `powerdev` MCP.
