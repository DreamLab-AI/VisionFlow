# Platform Management

## Overview
The Platform Management system handles device capabilities, feature detection, and runtime environment management. It serves as the central coordination point for platform-specific features and optimizations.

## Core Components

### PlatformManager (`client/platform/platformManager.ts`)
- Handles device capability detection
- Manages feature flags and runtime configurations
- Coordinates platform-specific initializations
- Provides unified interface for platform-specific operations

## Key Responsibilities

### 1. Capability Detection
- WebGL support and version
- WebXR availability
- GPU compute capabilities
- Memory constraints
- Input device support (SpaceMouse, VR controllers, etc.)

### 2. Feature Management
- Dynamic feature enabling/disabling based on platform capabilities
- Performance profile management
- Resource allocation strategies

### 3. Runtime Optimization
- Adapts rendering quality based on device capabilities
- Manages memory usage patterns
- Coordinates with GPU compute availability

## Integration Points

### Settings System
- Synchronizes with `SettingsStore` for platform-specific configurations
- Provides capability information for settings validation

### Rendering System
- Informs renderer of available capabilities
- Manages quality settings based on platform performance

### WebXR
- Coordinates XR device detection and initialization
- Manages XR session lifecycle

## Usage Example

```typescript
// Initialize platform manager
const platform = await PlatformManager.initialize();

// Check capabilities
if (platform.hasCapability('webxr')) {
    // Initialize XR features
}

// Get performance profile
const profile = platform.getPerformanceProfile();
```

## Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when features are unavailable
- Fallback strategies for unsupported capabilities
- Clear error reporting for diagnostic purposes
