# Feature Documentation Moved

The following documentation has been moved to better reflect its nature:

## AI Model Integrations

**Previous Location**: `/docs/guides/features/`

**New Location**: `/docs/guides/ai-models/`

### Moved Files

- `deepseek-verification.md` → `/docs/guides/ai-models/deepseek-verification.md`
- `deepseek-deployment.md` → `/docs/guides/ai-models/deepseek-deployment.md`

### New Documentation

The following comprehensive guides have been created:

- **[AI Models Overview](../ai-models/README.md)** - Complete overview of all AI service integrations
- **[Perplexity Integration](../ai-models/perplexity-integration.md)** - Detailed Perplexity AI documentation
- **[RAGFlow Integration](../ai-models/ragflow-integration.md)** - Complete RAGFlow knowledge base guide
- **[Integration Summary](../ai-models/INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md)** - Summary of integration work

## Rationale

AI model integrations (DeepSeek, Perplexity, RAGFlow, Z.AI, Gemini, OpenAI) are system-level services that span multiple features, not individual features themselves. They deserved their own dedicated section with comprehensive documentation covering:

- Service status and health
- Performance metrics
- Cost optimization
- Integration patterns
- Security considerations
- Troubleshooting guides
