### MCP Server Status

| Tool Name | Status | Type | Container | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `claude-flow` | ✅ Working | Direct | multi-agent | AI orchestration with memory and GOAP planning |
| `ruv-swarm` | ✅ Working | Direct | multi-agent | Multi-agent coordination and swarm intelligence |
| `flow-nexus` | ✅ Working | Direct | multi-agent | Workflow orchestration and task management |
| `playwright-mcp` | ✅ Working | Bridge | gui-tools | Browser automation and web scraping |
| `blender-mcp` | ⏳ GUI-dependent | Bridge | gui-tools | 3D modelling and rendering via external Blender instance |
| `qgis-mcp` | ⏳ GUI-dependent | Bridge | gui-tools | Geospatial analysis via external QGIS instance |
| `pbr-generator-mcp`| ⏳ GUI-dependent | Bridge | gui-tools | PBR texture generation via external service |
| `kicad-mcp` | ⏳ GUI-dependent | Bridge | gui-tools | Electronic Design Automation (EDA) using KiCad CLI |
| `imagemagick-mcp` | ⏳ GUI-dependent | Bridge | gui-tools | Image creation and manipulation using ImageMagick |

**Status Legend**:
- ✅ **Working**: Available immediately after container startup
- ⏳ **GUI-dependent**: Will show soft-fail timeout warnings until `gui-tools-container` services are fully initialized (30-60 seconds)

**Note**: GUI-dependent tools auto-recover once the GUI container is ready. Timeout warnings during startup are expected behaviour and do not affect core MCP functionality.

### 2.1. `blender-mcp`

- **Type**: Bridge
- **Purpose**: Provides an interface to a running Blender instance for 3D modelling, rendering, and scene manipulation.
- **Source File**: 
- **Server Logic**: 

#### Description
This tool acts as a bridge, forwarding commands from Claude Flow's `stdio` to the Blender MCP TCP server running within the `gui-tools-container`. The actual tool methods are defined in the Blender Python addon (`addon.py`).

#### Methods
The `blender-mcp` bridge is generic and forwards any `tool` and `params` it receives. The available methods are defined by the TCP server. Common methods include:
- `get-scene-info`: Retrieves information about the current Blender scene.
- `get-object-info`: Retrieves details about a specific object.
- `execute-code`: Executes arbitrary Python code within Blender's context.
- `get-viewport-screenshot`: Captures the current viewport as an image.
- `download-polyhaven-asset`: Downloads and imports an asset from PolyHaven.
- `create-rodin-job`: Creates a 3D modelling job using the Hyper3D Rodin API.
- `search-sketchfab-models`: Searches for models on Sketchfab.

#### Example Usage
```bash
./mcp-helper.sh run-tool blender-mcp '{
  "tool": "execute-code",

This tool is a bridge that connects to a custom TCP server running as a QGIS plugin. It forwards `stdio` requests to the QGIS instance.

#### Methods
Similar to the Blender tool, the available methods are defined by the QGIS plugin. Refer to the plugin's documentation for a complete list.

#### Example Usage
```bash
./mcp-helper.sh run-tool qgis-mcp '{
