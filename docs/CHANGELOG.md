## [Unreleased] - 2026-02-08

### Client Architecture Overhaul

#### Graph Worker & Physics

- **Position preservation in setGraphData()**: Worker now preserves interpolated positions for existing nodes when setGraphData is called (from initialGraphLoad, filter updates, reconnects). Only genuinely new nodes receive fresh positions, eliminating the visual "explosion" on graph reload.
- **Interpolation fix**: Server physics lerp factor was 1000x too slow due to `deltaTime / 1000` bug (deltaTime is already in seconds from Three.js clock). Fixed to `1 - Math.pow(0.001, deltaTime)`, converging in ~1 second instead of ~16 minutes.
- **Stable ID mapping**: Non-numeric node IDs now use FNV-1a hash (shared `stringToU32` in `client/src/types/idMapping.ts`) instead of unstable `index + 1`. Collision resolution via linear probe. Ensures consistent numeric IDs across setGraphData calls.
- **ForceComputeActor state preservation**: `iteration_count`, `stability_iterations`, and `reheat_factor` are no longer reset when settings updates arrive. Physics simulation maintains continuity across settings changes.

#### WebSocket Architecture

- **WebSocketEventBus** (`client/src/services/WebSocketEventBus.ts`): New typed pub/sub for cross-service WebSocket events. Event categories: `connection:open/close/error`, `message:graph/voice/bots/pod`, `registry:registered/unregistered/closedAll`.
- **WebSocketRegistry** (`client/src/services/WebSocketRegistry.ts`): Central connection lifecycle tracker. All WebSocket services (Voice, Bots, SolidPod, Graph) register/unregister connections through the registry.
- Eliminated `window.webSocketService` global in favour of direct module imports.

#### Settings Pipeline

- **Simplified useSelectiveSettingsStore**: Reduced from 548 to 152 lines. Removed manual caching, TTL, and debouncing; uses Zustand selectors natively.
- **Backend accepts partial JSON**: Physics and quality-gate PUT handlers now merge partial patches into current settings instead of requiring full payloads.
- **Quality gate defaults raised**: `maxNodeCount` increased from 10,000 to 500,000.

#### Visual System

- **MetadataShapes**: Now respects `nodeSize` setting (applies `sizeMultiplier`). Geometry sizes normalized to ~0.5 bounding sphere radius. Settings lookups hoisted out of per-node per-frame loop for performance.
- **KnowledgeRings**: Only renders on nodes positively identified as `knowledge_graph` type. No longer falls back to the `graphMode` default, preventing incorrect ring display on non-knowledge nodes.

#### Code Quality

- Deleted `lucide-react.d.ts` manual type declarations; converted 32 deep-path imports to barrel imports.
- Replaced `window.webSocketService` global with direct imports across all consuming modules.
- Removed V1 binary protocol dead code. Fixed V4 log spam (warn-once pattern).
- Replaced 14 `console.log` calls with proper logger usage.
- Removed dead functions/imports from GraphManager, websocketStore, and graphDataManager.

### Algorithm Pipeline Completion

- Wire SSSP distances into GPU force kernel `d_sssp_dist` buffer (SSSP-aware spring forces now active)
- Implement delta-stepping for GPU SSSP (configurable bucket width)
- Wire GPU APSP kernel (`approximate_apsp_kernel`) into `ShortestPathActor`
- Add multi-source batched SSSP for efficient landmark computation
- Implement LSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing) replacing O(n^2) pairwise similarity
- Add CPU SIMD vectorization (AVX2/SSE4.1) for physics fallback
- Implement A* search with Euclidean 3D heuristic
- Implement bidirectional Dijkstra for point-to-point queries
- Add semantic pathfinding with trait-based embedding provider

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-08

### Stabilization Sprint - 16 Commits

**Scope:** 6-agent diagnostic swarm identified 11 critical issues. All resolved across 16 commits with
21,853 lines of dead code removed, 474 cargo warnings eliminated, 44 mutation handlers secured,
and the agent telemetry pipeline wired end-to-end.

---

### Added

- **Agent telemetry pipeline** (a86fecda)
  - Management API receives bot metrics
  - `AgentMonitorActor` processes `UpdateBotsGraph` messages
  - `GraphServiceSupervisor` broadcasts binary node data

  - `AuthenticatedUser` extractor added to 44 mutation handlers across 8 endpoint groups
  - Supports `Authorization: Bearer <token>` + `X-Nostr-Pubkey` header
  - Dev bypass via `SETTINGS_AUTH_BYPASS=true` environment variable
  - Endpoint groups secured: analytics, semantic_forces, ontology_physics, bots, constraints, workspace, quest3, ragflow

- **Multi-graph rendering** (dc786e49)
  - Per-node type classification via binary protocol V3 bit flags
  - Bits 26-31 of node ID u32 encode type: 31=agent, 30=knowledge, 26-28=ontology subtypes
  - Parallel display of knowledge graph, ontology graph, and agent graph layers
  - Cluster hulls, KG rings, per-mode edge coloring (5462b9a2)

- **Real graph metrics** (d394fbc5)
  - BFS-based average path length replacing placeholder `4.2`
  - Triangle counting for clustering coefficient replacing placeholder `0.42`
  - Freeman centralization replacing placeholder `0.15`
  - Louvain-style modularity replacing placeholder `0.65`
  - Harmonic mean efficiency replacing placeholder `0.78`

- **Backend stub implementations** (a86fecda)
  - `RemoveOwlClass` directive: real Neo4j DELETE with event publication
  - `RemoveAxiom` directive: real Neo4j DELETE with relationship cleanup
  - `query_nodes`: real Cypher MATCH with property filtering
  - `constraint_stats`: real aggregation from constraint store
  - `extract_property_graph`: real Neo4j property graph extraction

### Changed

- **Docker build** (da510b29)
  - 5-stage multi-stage Dockerfile: deps, build, CUDA, frontend, runtime
  - Cargo dependency caching stage (rebuilds only on Cargo.lock change)
  - Parallel CUDA kernel compilation + frontend build
  - Final stage copies only release binary + static assets

- **Binary protocol V3 node type encoding** (dc786e49)
  - Extended bit flags from 2 bits (agent/knowledge) to 6 bits (26-31)
  - Ontology subtypes: bit 26 = class, bit 27 = individual, bit 28 = property

  - 11 inert `QualityGate` toggles disabled with tooltip explanations
  - 5 "coming soon" panels replaced with accurate status descriptions

  - Edge rendering no longer vanishes after settings save
  - Settings actor sends targeted update instead of full graph reload

- **Edge rendering** (a76ae3b8)

  - Physics simulation initializes in correct mode on first load
  - Fixed infinite loop in layout convergence check
  - Fixed overlay panel z-index conflict
  - Fixed spacemouse snap-to-origin on disconnect

- **Node positions** (eef7a786)
  - Instance buffer setup uses actual node positions instead of fallback circle pattern
