   - Priority: 1 (CRITICAL PATH)
   - Estimate: 120 hours

2. **PhysicsOrchestratorActor** (1,105 lines)
   - References: 34
   - Priority: 2 (HIGH)
   - Estimate: 32 hours

3. **GPU Actors** (6,917 lines total)
   - GPUManagerActor: 657 lines
   - ForceComputeActor: 1,047 lines
   - ClusteringActor: 715 lines
   - AnomalyDetectionActor: 918 lines
   - GPUResourceActor: 606 lines
   - StressMajorizationActor: 452 lines
   - OntologyConstraintActor: 549 lines
   - ConstraintActor: 327 lines
   - References: 278 combined
   - Priority: 3-10
   - Estimate: 112 hours

### Total Technical Debt:
- **Lines**: 12,588
- **References**: 502
- **Hours**: 304 (7-8 weeks)

## Verification Commands

### Check Current State (Before Migration):
```bash
# Count legacy references (should be 502)
./scripts/verify-no-legacy.sh

# Expected: ❌ FAILURE (legacy code exists)
```

### Check After Phase 1 (GraphServiceActor Removed):
```bash
grep -rn "GraphServiceActor" src/ --include="*.rs" | wc -l
# Expected: 0
```

### Check After Complete Migration:
```bash
./scripts/verify-no-legacy.sh

# Expected: ✅ SUCCESS: All legacy code has been removed!
# Exit code: 0
```

## Migration Roadmap

### Phase 0: Preparation (Week 1 - 40 hours) - CURRENT
- [x] Complete inventory ✅
- [x] Create timeline ✅
- [x] Create verification script ✅
- [x] Baseline cargo check ✅
- [ ] Mark legacy code as deprecated
- [ ] Create migration branch
- [ ] Set up feature flags

### Phase 1: GraphServiceActor (Weeks 2-4 - 120 hours)
- [ ] Implement repository layer
- [ ] Create CQRS commands/queries
- [ ] Migrate handlers
- [ ] Delete GraphServiceActor

### Phase 2: PhysicsOrchestratorActor (Week 5 - 32 hours)
- [ ] Create PhysicsService
- [ ] Consolidate physics logic
- [ ] Delete PhysicsOrchestratorActor

### Phase 3: GPU Actors (Weeks 6-7 - 112 hours)
- [ ] Create GPU services
- [ ] Replace actor calls with service calls
- [ ] Delete all GPU actors

### Phase 4: Final Cleanup (Week 8 - 40 hours)
- [ ] Remove actor infrastructure
- [ ] Clean up AppState
- [ ] Final verification
- [ ] Performance testing

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week):
1. Mark all legacy actors as `#[deprecated]`
2. Create feature branch: `feature/hexagonal-migration`
3. Add feature flags: `legacy_actors`
4. Create integration test suite

### Next Week (Start Phase 1):
1. Implement `GraphRepository` trait
2. Create `GraphCommandService`
3. Create `GraphQueryService`
4. Migrate first handler

### Continuous:
- Run `./scripts/verify-no-legacy.sh` after each commit
- Monitor cargo check warnings
- Track test coverage
- Benchmark performance
