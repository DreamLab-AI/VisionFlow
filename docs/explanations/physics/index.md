# Physics Documentation

Force-directed layouts, semantic forces, and GPU-accelerated physics simulation.

## Overview

VisionFlow uses physics simulation to create meaningful spatial layouts of knowledge graphs:

- Semantic relationships influence physical forces
- GPU-accelerated force calculations
- Real-time interactive manipulation
- Stress majorization for optimal layouts
