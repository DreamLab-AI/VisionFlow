# Architecture Documentation

*[Architecture](../index.md)*

System design documents, architectural decisions, and design patterns.

## Available Documentation

*This section will be populated as architecture documents are created and migrated.*

## Architecture Categories

### System Design
High-level system architecture, component interactions, and data flow.

### Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)
Documented decisions about system architecture and design trade-offs.

### Design Patterns
Common patterns used throughout the system and their implementations.

### Technology Choices
Documentation of technology stack decisions and rationale.

### Integration Architecture
Inter-system communication, APIs, and data exchange patterns.

## Contributing

When adding architecture documentation:

- Focus on design decisions and rationale
- Include diagrams where helpful
- Document trade-offs and alternatives considered
- Keep content current with system evolution
- Reference implementation details in technical docs
- Update this index when adding new documents
