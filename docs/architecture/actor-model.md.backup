# Actor Model Architecture

*[Architecture](../index.md)*

## Overview

VisionFlow uses the Actor Model for concurrent, fault-tolerant system design built on Actix actors.

## Actor System Design

For detailed information about our actor-based architecture, see:

- [System Overview](./system-overview.md) - Complete system architecture
- [Server Architecture](../server/architecture.md) - Server-side actor implementation

## Key Actors

Our main actors include:
- **ClaudeFlowActor**: MCP integration and agent orchestration
- **GraphActor**: Graph data management
- **GPUActor**: GPU compute coordination
- **ClientManager**: WebSocket client management
