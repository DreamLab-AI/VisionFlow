## Core Differentiators

### 1. **Decentralization** (Data Sovereignty)
**Problem**: Cloud providers can access customer data (Schrems II, PRISM scandal)
**Solution**: On-premises deployment; data never leaves customer network
**Benefit**: GDPR/HIPAA/ITAR compliance by design

**Industries**: Healthcare (patient data), Finance (trading strategies), Manufacturing (IP)

### 2. **GPU Acceleration** (100x Performance)
**Problem**: CPU-based simulations take hours/days
**Solution**: 100+ CUDA kernels for massive parallelism
**Benefit**: 60 FPS real-time vs batch processing

**Industries**: Gaming (100K entities), Scientific (protein folding), Manufacturing (digital twins)

### 3. **Real-Time Collaboration** (Only Solution)
**Problem**: Stakeholders can't explore simulations together
**Solution**: WebSocket multi-user 3D visualization
**Benefit**: Live decision-making vs static reports

**Industries**: Smart Cities (city council), Healthcare (surgery planning), Scientific (multi-PI)

### 4. **Zero Marginal Cost** (CAPEX vs OPEX)
**Problem**: Cloud costs scale linearly with usage
**Solution**: One-time hardware investment
**Benefit**: 22-99% TCO reduction over 5 years

**Industries**: All (especially high-utilization workloads)
