## Migration Strategies

### General Principles
1. **Parallel Development**: Run VisionFlow alongside existing tools (minimize risk)
2. **Hybrid Workflows**: Use VisionFlow for exploration, traditional for validation
3. **Pilot Program**: Start with 1 team/project, expand after success
4. **Training Investment**: 1-2 weeks onboarding (lower than traditional tools)

### Industry-Specific Paths

**Gaming: Unity → VisionFlow**
- **Timeline**: 4-6 weeks
- **Approach**: Plugin-based (keep Unity for graphics)
- **Risk**: Low (physics-only replacement)

**Scientific: GROMACS → VisionFlow**
- **Timeline**: 2 weeks
- **Approach**: Hybrid (GROMACS for production, VisionFlow for collaboration)
- **Risk**: Very low (complementary, not replacement)

**Manufacturing: ANSYS → VisionFlow**
- **Timeline**: 8-12 weeks
- **Approach**: VisionFlow for design iteration, ANSYS for validation
- **Risk**: Medium (require dual validation initially)

**Healthcare: SimMan → VisionFlow**
- **Timeline**: 4 weeks
- **Approach**: VisionFlow for volume training, keep SimMan for certification
- **Risk**: Low (software addition, not replacement)

**Finance: SAS → VisionFlow**
- **Timeline**: 6 months
- **Approach**: Shadow production (VisionFlow results vs SAS)
- **Risk**: High (regulatory scrutiny, require extensive validation)
