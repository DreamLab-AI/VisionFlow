# AR Hand Tracking Implementation Progress and Plan

## Overview
- Client code in `client/xr/xrSessionManager.ts` manages XR sessions and hand tracking.
- We are addressing performance issues on Meta Quest 3 AR passthrough mode and ensuring proper cleanup of virtual desktop instances when AR is activated.

## Progress So Far
- Diagnosed type mismatches between the standard `XRHand` type (as defined by THREE.XRHand) and our custom `XRHandWithHaptics`.
- Attempted several diffs in the onXRFrame method to correctly extract the "index-finger-tip" joint.
- Encountered repeated errors: conversion issues between `XRHand` and `XRHandWithHaptics`, and missing properties such as `matrixWorld` and `position` on `XRJointSpace`.

## Challenges
- The WebXR API’s `XRHand` type (THREE.XRHand) lacks the extended properties expected by our custom type.
- Our custom `XRHandWithHaptics` type, intended to provide additional haptic and joint details, does not align with the native XRHand, leading to conversion and type compatibility errors.
- Extracting joint positions (e.g., index-finger-tip) is problematic due to these type definition conflicts.

## Plan Moving Forward
- **Reconcile Type Definitions:** Investigate and potentially implement an adapter to convert the standard `XRHand` into our custom `XRHandWithHaptics`, or adjust the VisualizationController to accept the native XRHand.
- **Determine Position Extraction Method:** Review official WebXR documentation to identify the correct method for extracting joint position data from an `XRJointSpace`.
- **Update onXRFrame Logic:** Modify the hand tracking code in `client/xr/xrSessionManager.ts` to robustly handle hand input without type conflicts.
- **Testing:** Verify that changes resolve performance issues and properly transition from desktop to AR mode on the Meta Quest 3.

## Current Paused State
- The onXRFrame method’s hand tracking block (lines 473–479) remains unresolved due to type mismatches between XRHand and XRHandWithHaptics.
- We are pausing at this point until the type reconciliation and position extraction method are properly resolved.

## Next Steps
- Investigate conversion or adapter strategies to bridge the standard XRHand and our XRHandWithHaptics.
- Possibly refactor the VisualizationController to work with the native XRHand type.
- Consult official documentation to clarify expected properties for joint spaces.
- Test updated implementation on Meta Quest 3.

## Summary
Multiple fixes have been attempted, but type conflicts have prevented a correct implementation of hand input handling. A careful reassessment of type definitions and consultation of the WebXR documentation is required to move forward.

## Conclusion
This document summarizes our progress, challenges, and plans for implementing AR hand tracking on Meta Quest 3. It provides context for future work and serves as a checkpoint in our development process.
