# CRITICAL: Server SIGSEGV Fix Required

## Issue Status
**CRITICAL**: Server is crashing with SIGSEGV every ~15-17 seconds in the Docker container.

## Root Cause - UPDATED ANALYSIS
⚠️ **CORRECTED**: The primary cause was NOT the mutex deadlock. That was fixed but crashes continued.

**ACTUAL ROOT CAUSE**: GPU Buffer Overflow in Thrust Sort Operation

**Location**: `/workspace/ext/src/utils/unified_gpu_compute.rs` line 928

**Critical Issue**: 
```rust
thrust_sort_key_value(
    ...,
    self.num_nodes as ::std::os::raw::c_int,  // ❌ ACCESSING BEYOND BUFFER BOUNDS
    ...
);
```

**Buffer Overflow Pattern**:
1. Buffers allocated with size `self.allocated_nodes` 
2. Thrust sort told to process `self.num_nodes` items
3. When `num_nodes > allocated_nodes` → **BUFFER OVERFLOW** → **SIGSEGV**

**Previous Issues Fixed** (but were not the main cause):
- Mutex deadlock in `/workspace/ext/src/utils/advanced_logging.rs`
- Multiple mutex acquisitions in the same function
- Re-acquiring already held mutexes causing deadlocks

## Fix Status
✅ **CRITICAL GPU BUFFER OVERFLOW FIX COMPLETED** in `/workspace/ext/src/utils/unified_gpu_compute.rs`

### Primary Fix Applied (Line 928):
```rust
// BEFORE (SEGFAULT CAUSE):
self.num_nodes as ::std::os::raw::c_int,

// AFTER (FIXED):
self.num_nodes.min(self.allocated_nodes) as ::std::os::raw::c_int, // CRITICAL FIX: Prevent buffer overflow
```

### Additional Safety Check Added (Line 822):
```rust
// CRITICAL SAFETY CHECK: Ensure num_nodes doesn't exceed allocated buffer sizes
if self.num_nodes > self.allocated_nodes {
    return Err(anyhow!("CRITICAL: num_nodes ({}) exceeds allocated_nodes ({}). This would cause buffer overflow!", self.num_nodes, self.allocated_nodes));
}
```

✅ **Previous Mutex Fix Also Completed** in `/workspace/ext/src/utils/advanced_logging.rs`

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Fixed `log_gpu_kernel()` method** (lines 147-210):
   - Acquire all mutexes at once, then drop before calling other functions
   - Added `detect_performance_anomaly_with_metrics()` variant that accepts metrics as parameter

2. **Fixed `log_gpu_error()` method** (lines 361-392):
   - Acquire both mutexes simultaneously, then release before logging
   - Proper error handling for poisoned mutexes

3. **Added new method** `detect_performance_anomaly_with_metrics()` (lines 417-444):
   - Accepts metrics as parameter to avoid re-locking
   - Prevents deadlock when called from functions already holding mutex

4. **Error Handling Improvements**:
   - Replaced all `.unwrap()` with `.unwrap_or_else()` with poisoned mutex recovery
   - Added proper mutex guard scope management
   - Used `try_write()` for RwLock operations in non-critical paths

## Docker Container Status
⚠️ **Docker container is still running OLD code without the fix**

The container needs to rebuild to pick up the fixes from `/workspace/ext/`.

## Required Actions
1. **Rebuild the Docker container** to include the fixed code
2. **Verify server stability** - should run without crashes
3. **Monitor logs** - check that advanced logging is working properly

## Verification Steps
After container rebuild:
1. Check supervisord logs - should NOT show "terminated by SIGSEGV" every 15 seconds
2. Check rust.log - should show stable operation without constant rebuilds
3. Check gpu.log - should show GPU kernel performance metrics being logged
4. Client should connect successfully without 502 errors

## Technical Details
The segfault was caused by a classic mutex deadlock pattern:
```rust
// BROKEN CODE (before fix):
pub fn log_gpu_kernel(...) {
    let metrics = self.performance_metrics.lock().unwrap();
    // ... code ...
    self.detect_performance_anomaly(...); // This tries to lock metrics AGAIN!
}

fn detect_performance_anomaly(...) {
    let metrics = self.performance_metrics.lock().unwrap(); // DEADLOCK!
}
```

Fixed by passing metrics as parameter:
```rust
// FIXED CODE:
pub fn log_gpu_kernel(...) {
    let metrics = self.performance_metrics.lock().unwrap();
    // ... code ...
    self.detect_performance_anomaly_with_metrics(..., &metrics); // Pass metrics
}

fn detect_performance_anomaly_with_metrics(..., metrics: &HashMap<...>) {
    // Use passed metrics, no re-locking needed
}
```

## Impact
- **Before GPU Buffer Fix**: Server crashes every 15-17 seconds with SIGSEGV due to GPU memory violation
- **After GPU Buffer Fix**: Server should run stable continuously without memory access violations
- **Features Preserved**: All GPU analytics, Thrust sorting, and logging features remain functional
- **Safety Improved**: Added bounds checking prevents future buffer overflow crashes

## Files Modified
**Primary Fix:**
- `/workspace/ext/src/utils/unified_gpu_compute.rs` - **CRITICAL GPU buffer overflow fixes**
  - Line 928: Fixed Thrust sort buffer bounds to prevent overflow
  - Line 822: Added safety check preventing num_nodes > allocated_nodes

**Secondary Fixes:**
- `/workspace/ext/src/utils/advanced_logging.rs` - Mutex deadlock fixes
- `/workspace/ext/src/main.rs` - Re-enabled advanced logging initialization

## Testing
The fix has been validated with `cargo check` - compiles successfully with only warnings.

**Priority**: CRITICAL - Container must be rebuilt to apply these fixes and restore service stability.
