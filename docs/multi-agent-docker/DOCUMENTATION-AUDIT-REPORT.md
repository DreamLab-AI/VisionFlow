## Conclusion

All documentation in the root `/mnt/mldata/githubs/AR-AI-Knowledge-Graph/multi-agent-docker` directory has been audited and updated to reflect the current architecture. Key improvements include unified stdout/stderr logging documentation, accurate resource provisioning details, clear MCP server status indicators, and comprehensive troubleshooting guidance for GUI-dependent tool initialization.

The documentation now accurately represents:
- ✅ Verbose logging with timestamps to stdout/stderr
- ✅ Supervisord logging redirect to `/dev/stdout` and `/dev/stderr`
- ✅ Default 16GB RAM / 4 CPU resource allocation
- ✅ Configurable via `DOCKER_MEMORY` and `DOCKER_CPUS` environment variables
- ✅ Claude-flow MCP server corrected to latest @alpha
- ✅ GUI MCP servers (blender, qgis, imagemagick, kicad) soft-fail behavior
- ✅ Expected 30-60 second timeout warnings during initialization
- ✅ Auto-recovery when GUI container services start

All changes are backward-compatible and do not require code modifications. Documentation is now production-ready.
