# Getting Started with VisionFlow

Welcome to VisionFlow, an enterprise-grade multi-agent knowledge graphing system with GPU-accelerated semantic physics and 3D visualization.

## Quick Start Path

Get up and running in 15 minutes:

| Step | Document | Time |
|------|----------|------|
| 1 | [What is VisionFlow?](/OVERVIEW/) | 5 min |
| 2 | [Installation](/tutorials/01-installation/) | 10 min |
| 3 | [Create First Graph](/tutorials/02-first-graph/) | 15 min |
| 4 | [Navigation Guide](/guides/navigation-guide/) | 10 min |

## Choose Your Path

### New to VisionFlow?

Start with the [Overview](/OVERVIEW/) to understand what VisionFlow does and why you might use it, then follow the [Installation Tutorial](/tutorials/01-installation/).

### Ready to Build?

Jump to the [First Graph Tutorial](/tutorials/02-first-graph/) to create your first knowledge graph visualization with AI agents.

### Need to Configure?

See the [Configuration Guide](/guides/configuration/) for environment variables and advanced settings.

## What You Will Learn

- **Installation**: Docker and native setup for Linux, macOS, and Windows
- **Core Concepts**: Knowledge graphs, semantic physics, and AI orchestration
- **First Visualization**: Creating and exploring your first 3D graph
- **Navigation**: Mastering the 3D interface controls

## Prerequisites

- Docker 20.10+ and Docker Compose 2.0+
- Modern web browser (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, or Edge 90+)
- 8GB RAM minimum (16GB recommended)
- Optional: NVIDIA GPU for accelerated physics

## Next Steps
