# GPU Stability Gates Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds GPU-based stability gates to the physics simulation to prevent 100% GPU usage when the graph reaches equilibrium. The system now efficiently detects when nodes have stopped moving and skips expensive physics calculations.

## Key Features

### 1. GPU-Based Kinetic Energy Calculation
- **Kernel**: `calculate_kinetic_energy_kernel`
- Calculates kinetic energy directly on GPU using block-level reduction
- Tracks the number of actively moving nodes
- No need to copy velocity data to CPU

### 2. System Stability Detection
- **Kernel**: `check_system_stability_kernel`
- Performs final reduction of kinetic energy values
- Checks two conditions:
  - Average kinetic energy below threshold
  - Less than 1% of nodes actively moving
- Sets a flag to skip physics if system is stable

### 3. Optimized Force Calculation
- **Kernel**: `force_pass_with_stability_kernel`
- Adds per-node stability checking
- Skips force calculation for stationary nodes
- Global early exit if entire system is stable

## Configuration Parameters

```rust
pub struct SimParams {
    // ...
    pub stability_threshold: f32,      // KE threshold (default: 1e-6)
    pub min_velocity_threshold: f32,   // Min velocity (default: 1e-4)
}
```

## Performance Benefits

1. **Reduced GPU Usage**: When the system is stable, GPU usage drops from 100% to near 0%
2. **No CPU-GPU Transfer**: Stability checking happens entirely on GPU
3. **Per-Node Optimization**: Individual stationary nodes skip force calculations
4. **Early Exit**: Entire physics pipeline can be skipped when stable

## Usage Example

```rust
// Set stability thresholds
let sim_params = SimParams {
    stability_threshold: 1e-6,        // Adjust based on your needs
    min_velocity_threshold: 1e-4,     // Nodes below this velocity are ignored
    // ... other parameters
};

// The system will automatically detect stability and reduce GPU usage
gpu_compute.execute(sim_params)?;
```

## Implementation Details

### Kinetic Energy Calculation
- Uses shared memory for efficient block-level reduction
- Calculates KE = 0.5 * mass * velocityÂ²
- Counts nodes with velocity above threshold

### Stability Detection Algorithm
```cuda
bool energy_stable = avg_ke < stability_threshold;
bool motion_stable = active_nodes < max(1, num_nodes / 100);
should_skip_physics = energy_stable || motion_stable;
```

### Memory Requirements
- Additional buffers:
  - `partial_kinetic_energy`: One float per thread block
  - `active_node_count`: Single integer
  - `should_skip_physics`: Single integer flag
  - `system_kinetic_energy`: Single float for monitoring

## Debugging

Enable debug output by checking iteration count:
```cuda
if (iteration % 600 == 0 && should_skip_physics) {
    printf("[GPU Stability Gate] System stable: avg_KE=%.8f, active=%d/%d\n", 
           avg_ke, active_nodes, num_nodes);
}
```

## Future Optimizations

1. **Adaptive Thresholds**: Automatically adjust thresholds based on graph size
2. **Progressive Stability**: Gradually reduce computation for semi-stable regions
3. **Temporal Coherence**: Use previous frame's stability to predict current frame
4. **Multi-Level Stability**: Different thresholds for different graph components
