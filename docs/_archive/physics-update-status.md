# Physics Settings Update - Current Status

## ‚úÖ What's Working
1. **Client ‚Üí REST API**: Settings updates are successfully sent from the UI
   - Console shows: "Successfully updated 1 settings using batch endpoint"
   - HTTP requests are returning 200 OK

2. **REST API ‚Üí settings.yaml**: The YAML file is being updated correctly
   - Current values show the changes are saved:
   - Logseq: `repelK: 162.31377`, `springK: 1.8978071`, `attractionK: 0.6819533`

3. **Server Restart ‚Üí Load Settings**: When the server restarts, it loads the new values
   - After restart at 10:30:17, server is using `repel_k: 162.31377` (updated value)

## ‚ùå What's Not Working
1. **Runtime Updates**: Changes made while the server is running don't affect the physics simulation
   - The server needs to be restarted to pick up changes
   - This is because the old code doesn't have the `propagate_physics_to_gpu` calls

## üìä Evidence from Latest Test (10:30-10:32)
- **10:30:17**: Server restarted, loaded settings with new physics values
- **10:31:03-16**: User made several physics adjustments via UI
- **Settings.yaml**: Updated correctly with new values
- **Server logs**: Still using values from startup (no UpdateSimulationParams messages)
- **Result**: Physics simulation not responding to runtime changes

## üîß Solution Status
The code fixes have been applied to:
1. `/workspace/ext/src/handlers/settings_handler.rs` - Added propagate_physics_to_gpu calls
2. `/workspace/ext/src/actors/graph_actor.rs` - Fixed target_params update
3. Client-side paths corrected

**Next Step**: Server needs to be rebuilt and deployed with the fixed code

## üéØ Expected Behavior After Fix
Once the server is rebuilt with the fixes:
1. User changes physics control in UI
2. Client sends update to REST API
3. REST API updates settings.yaml AND calls propagate_physics_to_gpu
4. GraphServiceActor receives UpdateSimulationParams message
5. Both simulation_params and target_params are updated
6. Physics simulation immediately uses new values (no restart needed)
