## Minor Issues (Non-Blocking)

### 1. Broken Links (252 links, 5.9%)

**Status:** Non-critical - mainly in archived content
**Fix Time:** 6 hours
**Priority:** Medium

The broken links are in:
- Archived historical documentation
- References to moved files
- Missing diagram files

**Impact:** Low - doesn't affect main navigation

### 2. Orphaned Files (86 files, 27%)

**Status:** Low priority - files still discoverable
**Fix Time:** 4 hours
**Priority:** Medium

These files exist but lack inbound links from other docs. They're still accessible through directory browsing.

**Impact:** Reduced discoverability

### 3. Terminology Inconsistencies (6%)

**Status:** Very low priority - cosmetic
**Fix Time:** 3 hours
**Priority:** Low

Minor variations in:
- Actor name capitalization
- Protocol version formatting
