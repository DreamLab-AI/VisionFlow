## Your First Multi-Agent Workflow

### What are Multi-Agent Systems?

Multi-agent systems in VisionFlow are intelligent AI agents that work together to solve complex problems. Each agent has specialised capabilities:

- **Coordinator**: Orchestrates tasks and manages workflow
- **Researcher**: Gathers information and analyzes requirements
- **Coder**: Implements solutions and writes code
- **Architect**: Designs system structure and patterns
- **Tester**: Creates tests and validates implementations
- **Reviewer**: Ensures code quality and best practices

### Initialize Your First Multi-Agent System

#### Step 1: Access the Multi-Agent Panel
1. Look for the **"VisionFlow (MCP)"** section in the left control panel
2. You should see an **"Initialize multi-agent"** button if no agents are active
3. Click this button to open the configuration dialogue

#### Step 2: Configure Your Agents
Fill in the multi-agent configuration form:

**Task Description:**
Start with a simple, clear task. Here are some beginner-friendly examples:

```
Create a simple REST API with user authentication
```

```
Write unit tests for a calculator module
```

```
Build a basic React component with state management
```

**Topology Selection:**
- **Mesh**: Best for collaborative tasks (recommended for beginners)
- **Hierarchical**: Structured approach with clear leadership
- **Star**: Central coordination model
- **Ring**: Sequential processing

**Agent Selection:**
For your first workflow, try this combination:
- ‚úÖ Coordinator (always recommended)
- ‚úÖ Researcher
- ‚úÖ Coder
- ‚úÖ Tester

**Settings:**
- **Maximum Agents**: Start with 4-6 agents
- **Neural Enhancement**: Enable for better performance
- **GPU Acceleration**: Enable if you have a compatible GPU

#### Step 3: Deploy Your Agents
1. Click **"Spawn Hive Mind"** to start the agent deployment
2. Watch the 3D visualisation as agents appear as nodes
3. Observe the connections forming between agents as they communicate

#### Step 4: Monitor Agent Activity
As your agents work:
- **Node Colors**: Different colors represent agent types and states
  - üîµ Blue: Coordinator agents
  - üü¢ Green: Researcher agents
  - üü° Yellow: Coder agents
  - üü† Orange: Tester agents
  - ‚ö™ White: Idle agents
  - üî¥ Red: Agents with errors

- **Edge Thickness**: Thicker connections indicate more communication
- **Node Movement**: Active agents move more dynamically
- **Pulsing**: Indicates agents are processing tasks

#### Step 5: Review Results
1. Check the **Activity Log** panel for detailed agent communications
2. View **Task Progress** to see completion status
3. Examine any **Generated Files** or **Code Output**
4. Review **Performance Metrics** to understand efficiency

### Sample Multi-Agent Workflows
