# Working Documents Archive (2025-11-05)

This archive contains working documents that have been integrated into the main documentation corpus during the Phase 1 and Phase 2 documentation alignment (November 5, 2025).

## Archive Purpose

These documents served as working drafts and audit reports during active development. Their knowledge has been extracted and reformatted into production-ready documentation located in the main `/docs` structure.

## Integration Summary

**Total Working Document Lines:** 2,674
**Total Integrated Documentation Lines:** 6,986

**Quality Improvements:**
- ✅ ASCII diagrams → Mermaid (GitHub-compatible)
- ✅ Working draft format → Production documentation
- ✅ Flat structure → Hierarchical with cross-references
- ✅ Internal notes → Public-facing explanations
- ✅ Code snippets → Complete examples with context

## Why Archive?

1. **Preservation:** Historical record of development thought process
2. **Reference:** Original context for integrated content
3. **Audit Trail:** Track evolution from working draft to production doc
4. **Clean Structure:** Main docs contain only active, public-facing content

## Using Archived Content

**If you need to reference these documents:**

1. **For current information:** Use the integrated documentation in `/docs`
2. **For historical context:** Reference these archived versions
3. **For comparison:** See how raw notes evolved into polished docs

**Do NOT:**
- Link to these files from active documentation
- Update these files (they are snapshots)
- Use as primary reference (use integrated docs)

## Archive Date

**Archived:** November 5, 2025
**Archive Reason:** Phase 1 & Phase 2 documentation corpus alignment complete
