## GPU Actor Handler Analysis

-   **Files:** `gpu-actor-handlers-analysis.md`, `gpu-handlers-deletion-guide.md`, `gpu-handlers-summary.txt`
-   **Summary:** An analysis of GPU actor handlers revealed several incorrect or stubbed implementations, particularly in `clustering_actor.rs` and `force_compute_actor.rs`. The investigation found handlers that returned "not yet implemented" errors despite the functionality existing elsewhere in the codebase. The recommendation was to delete the redundant or incorrect handlers to clean up the actor implementations.

## Settings Handlers Consolidation

-   **File:** `settings-handlers-consolidation-plan.md`
-   **Summary:** This document addresses route conflicts between two competing settings handlers: `settings_handler.rs` and `settings_paths.rs`. The plan recommends deprecating the simpler, redundant `settings_paths.rs` and consolidating all functionality into the more feature-rich and actively used `settings_handler.rs`. This resolves API conflicts and reduces technical debt.

## Whelk-rs Configuration Report

-   **File:** `whelk-rs-configuration-report.md`
-   **Summary:** This report details the effort to configure the `whelk-rs` library as a local path dependency. While the dependency itself was resolved correctly, the project failed to compile due to a missing `AnnotatedAxiom` type definition in the adapter code that integrates with the `horned-owl` crate. The document outlines the problem and suggests steps to investigate the `horned-owl` API to resolve the type mismatch.

## Legacy Code Audit

-   **File:** `legacy-code-audit.md`
-   **Summary:** This audit identified several pieces of deprecated code that were still active in the codebase. Key findings included the continued existence of the `GpuPhysicsAdapter` port, the `NetworkRecoveryManager`, and the `ErrorRecoveryMiddleware`, all of which were intended for removal. The report recommended the complete deletion of these components to align the codebase with the new architecture.
