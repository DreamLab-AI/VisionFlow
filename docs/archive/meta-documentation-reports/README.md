# Meta-Documentation Reports

**Archived**: 2026-01-12
**Reason**: One-time documentation audit reports no longer needed in main docs directory

## Contents

These files document previous documentation cleanup/modernization efforts:

1. `FINAL_LINK_VERIFICATION.md` - Link verification report (2025-12-19)
2. `LINK_REPAIR_REPORT.md` - Link repair summary
3. `LINK_VALIDATION_COMPLETE.md` - Link validation completion report
4. `DOCUMENTATION_MODERNIZATION_COMPLETE.md` - Modernization completion report
5. `MERMAID_FIXES_STATS.json` - Mermaid diagram fix statistics

## Purpose

These were generated during documentation cleanup operations and serve as historical records. They are not reference documentation for users.
