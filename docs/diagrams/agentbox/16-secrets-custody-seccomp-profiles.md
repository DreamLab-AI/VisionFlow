## AB-16.2 The seccomp profile is a supplemental denylist, not a sandbox

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class SeccompProfile {
        <<agentbox/config/seccomp-agentbox.json>>
        +string defaultAction
        +List~string~ architectures

        +not implicitly stacked
    }
    SeccompProfile --> RuleAfAlg
    SeccompProfile --> RuleHighRisk
    SeccompProfile ..> DockerDefault : explicit security_opt overrides default
    note for SeccompProfile "defaultAction = SCMP_ACT_ALLOW. This is INTENTIONALLY allow-by-default.<br/>The file calls itself supplemental, but explicit Docker security_opt selects it IN PLACE OF the default profile.<br/>An allowlist was REJECTED deliberately — the workload surface (Chromium, CUDA, Godot) is too wide to enumerate safely without breakage.<br/>architectures: SCMP_ARCH_X86_64, X86, AARCH64, ARM."
    note for RuleAfAlg "CVE-2026-31431 'Copy Fail' — blocks AF_ALG (family 38) socket creation,<br/>the algif_aead local privesc via splice(). Arg-indexed, so other socket families are unaffected."
    note for RuleHighRisk "add_key bpf clock_adjtime clock_settime create_module delete_module finit_module get_kernel_syms get_mempolicy<br/>init_module ioperm iopl kcmp kexec_file_load kexec_load keyctl lookup_dcookie mbind mount move_pages nfsservctl<br/>perf_event_open pivot_root process_vm_readv process_vm_writev ptrace query_module quotactl reboot request_key<br/>set_mempolicy setns settimeofday stime swapon swapoff sysfs _sysctl umount umount2 unshare uselib userfaultfd ustat vm86 vm86old"
    note for DockerDefault "DIVERGENCE — reading this file as the confinement boundary is wrong.<br/>Confinement comes from the COMBINATION: cap_drop ALL, read_only root, uid 1000, no-new-privileges,<br/>plus the selected custom seccomp profile and any independently configured host controls. Docker's default is not automatically stacked. see AB-16.1"

## AB-16.3 check-seccomp.sh — the invariant gate

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant CI as CI / pre-rebuild
    participant SH as check-seccomp.sh<br/>agentbox/scripts/ci/check-seccomp.sh
    participant F as seccomp-agentbox.json<br/>agentbox/config/seccomp-agentbox.json
    participant NODE as embedded node heredoc

    CI->>SH: sh scripts/ci/check-seccomp.sh
    SH->>SH: set -eu then ROOT resolve then FILE = $ROOT/config/seccomp-agentbox.json
    alt file missing

    SH->>NODE: node - FILE BASELINE (all 46 syscall names)

    alt parse throws
        NODE-->>CI: FAIL — the profile no longer parses
    end
    NODE->>NODE: assert doc.defaultAction === 'SCMP_ACT_ALLOW'
    Note over NODE: the gate asserts the profile STAYS allow-by-default — a well-meaning switch to a denylist default would FAIL this check,<br/>because that would silently turn a supplemental layer into a broken half-allowlist
    loop for each REQUIRED syscall
        NODE->>F: find an SCMP_ACT_ERRNO rule whose names include it
        alt not found
            NODE-->>CI: FAIL — a denial was dropped
        end
    end
    NODE-->>CI: exit 0
    Note over SH,NODE: RESOLVED ADR-2046 — all 46 unconditional syscall denials are gate-protected.<br/>The gate separately verifies socket / argument index 0 / AF_ALG 38 / SCMP_CMP_EQ.<br/>This is a structural source gate, not an attestation of a running container filter.

## AB-16.4 Boot privilege drop and the trust-seed hook

    SUP->>EP: run bootstrap
    rect rgb(255,248,235)

    EP->>TS: node /opt/agentbox/config/hooks/trust-seed.cjs (runs first, every boot)
    EP->>SET: read settings.json hooks.SessionStart

        TS->>CFG: mark trusted, SKIP node_modules target .tmp .cache .venv venv .git dist build
    end
    Note over TS,CFG: INVARIANT trust-seed.cjs:13 — never removes or overwrites other per-project state. Idempotent, safe to run at any time.
    alt any error
        TS-->>EP: one line to stderr then exit 0 — FAIL-OPEN so hooks and boot never stall
    end
    SUP->>CC: start every long-running program with user=devuser
    CC-->>CC: no "Do you trust the files in this folder?" dialog
    Note over TS,CC: rationale trust-seed.cjs:7 — observed 2026-09-02, ten Opus worker panes sat dead for an hour behind the trust gate.<br/>DIVERGENCE — this pre-accepts a SECURITY prompt for unattended agents. It is a deliberate availability-over-confirmation trade, not a hardening measure.
```

## AB-16.5 Derived keys — HMAC-SHA256 domain separation

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant ENV as operator key<br/>AGENTBOX_PRIVKEY_HEX or AGENTBOX_BRIDGE_SK or OPERATOR_NOSTR_PRIVKEY
    participant GW as gateway.cjs<br/>agentbox/config/nostr-gateway/gateway.cjs:171-178

    alt not 64-hex
        GW-->>GW: log "no operator key (AGENTBOX_PRIVKEY_HEX) — exiting" then process.exit(0)
        Note over GW: FAIL-CLOSED by exit — the gateway refuses to run keyless rather than degrading
    end
    GW->>GW: adminPub = getPublicKey(rawSk) — the ONLY pubkey allowed to command
    alt AGENTBOX_GATEWAY_IDENTITY === 'gateway'
        GW->>GW: sk = HMAC-SHA256(operator_sk, AGENTBOX_GATEWAY_KEY_TAG or 'agentbox-gateway-v1')
    else default 'operator'
        GW->>GW: sk = rawSk — the gateway signs AS the operator
        Note over GW: DIVERGENCE — the DEFAULT identity is 'operator', so out of the box the gateway holds and signs with the ROOT operator key.<br/>The derived-child mode exists but is opt-in via env.
    end
    GW->>RELAY: auth and receive as getPublicKey(sk), reply to AGENTBOX_GATEWAY_REPLY_TO or adminPub
    end
    rect rgb(240,255,240)
    Note over MIR,PHONE: mirror child key — nostr-live-mirror.cjs:209
    MIR->>MIR: cached in _childCache, computed once per process
    alt AGENTBOX_MIRROR_CHILD === '0'
        MIR-->>MIR: null — child mode off, LEGACY operator-self-DM path is used instead
    else operator key not 64-hex
        MIR-->>MIR: null — same legacy fallback
    else
        MIR->>MIR: child_sk = HMAC-SHA256(operator_sk, AGENTBOX_MIRROR_KEY_TAG or 'agentbox-mirror-v1')
        MIR->>PHONE: only the CHILD nsec is imported to the device — the root operator key stays off the phone
        Note over MIR,PHONE: rotatable by bumping the tag. The mirror is a self-DM on the child identity, and the child signs nothing of consequence. see AB-13
    end
    end
    Note over GW,MIR: DIVERGENCE ADR-2027 — neither derived key appears in the SECURITY-profiles provisional custody register.<br/>Both are bespoke HMAC-SHA256 constructions rather than a standard KDF (HKDF), and rotation is "bump the env tag" with no revocation of the previously derived child at any relay.

            end
        end
    end
    rect rgb(255,240,240)

    ADR-->>PX: expiry check exists — unset expiry permits unbounded lifetime
    ADR-->>PX: method and path scope checks exist — unset scope is unrestricted
    ADR-->>PX: fingerprinted acceptance/refusal logs exist — durable per-use receipt is unproven
    ADR-->>PX: full lifecycle needs configured bounds, custodians and tested revocation
    end
    Note over ATK,PX: DIVERGENCE INGRESS-identity "Break-glass bearer over the LAN" — accepted on port 9096 AND via ?access_token= / ?bearer= on WS upgrades.<br/>A single shared secret bypasses NIP-98 entirely. Documented opt-in, but a full identity bypass while enabled. see AB-10.9
    Note over ADR: ADR-2027 record status: decision proposed, implementation none, activation inactive.<br/>Policy status remains proposed for the complete lifecycle.<br/>Optional bounds and fingerprint logs ARE implemented — lifecycle completion and deployed configuration are not certified.

## AB-16.7 Key files at 0600 — what that boundary is and is not

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber

    participant KF as profile key file
    participant AOE as AoE daemon token<br/>~/.config/agent-of-empires/serve.url
    participant BSK as bridge key<br/>AGENTBOX_BRIDGE_SK_FILE default /run/secrets/nostr.key
    participant PEER as any co-resident devuser process

    AI->>KF: writeFileSync(privHex, mode 0o600) then chmodSync 0o600 (agent-identity.js:141-142)
    Note over AI,KF: comment at agent-identity.js:139 — "Persist with 0600 so the key survives a restart of this profile and no other uid can read it"
    AOE-->>AOE: minted by the daemon at launch into an owner-only 0700 directory, not env-settable
    BSK-->>BSK: loaded by nostr-pod-bridge, legacy environment fallback still present
    rect rgb(255,240,240)
    Note over PEER,BSK: the residual limit, stated in the governing docs
    PEER->>KF: read — SUCCEEDS, same uid
    PEER->>AOE: read — SUCCEEDS, same uid
    PEER->>BSK: read — SUCCEEDS, same uid
    end
    Note over PEER: DIVERGENCE GOVERNANCE-capabilities item 5 — "a process running as the same devuser can still read the token file.<br/>The token raises the bar but does not isolate same-uid peers. Per-process isolation is future work."<br/>The same sentence applies verbatim to the agent key and the bridge key. see AB-16.1
    Note over AI,KF: DIVERGENCE SECURITY-profiles custody row — persistence failure is NON-FATAL (agent-identity.js:145-148),<br/>so a container can run a whole session on an in-memory key that vanishes at restart. "Key persistence failure can produce a valid but unstable identity." see AB-11.2
```

## AB-16.8 A secret's lifecycle — implemented versus proposed

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Provisioned
    Provisioned --> InUse : loaded at boot from env, key file or daemon state file
    InUse --> InUse : used per request with no per-use receipt
    InUse --> Derived : HMAC-SHA256 with a domain tag produces a child (gateway, mirror)
    Derived --> InUse
    InUse --> BackedUp : scripts/backup-secrets.sh collects selected config names into a ZIP
    BackedUp --> InUse
    InUse --> RotatedProposed : ADR-2027 rotation cadence
    InUse --> RevokedProposed : ADR-2027 revocation path
    RotatedProposed --> [*]
    RevokedProposed --> [*]
    note right of Provisioned
        IMPLEMENTED. Storage interfaces exist and are source-verified:
        0600 profile key file, /run/secrets/nostr.key, the AoE serve.url
        state file, NIP98_PROXY_ALLOW_BEARER and NIP98_PROXY_SESSION_SECRET
        captured at process start.
    end note
    note right of BackedUp
        PARTIAL and unverified. SECURITY-profiles: the backup script invokes
        ordinary zip and unzip integrity testing with NO encryption flags and
        no explicit umask or chmod. Final permissions depend on the invoking
        environment. Integrity testing is not a recovery exercise. The script
        was not run and no backup contents were inspected.
    end note
    note right of RotatedProposed
        NOT IMPLEMENTED. ADR-2027 is proposed / none / inactive.
        No cadence, no custodian, no incident window, no revocation
        procedure and no dated failure-recovery receipt exists for
        any of the seven register rows.
    end note
    note right of RevokedProposed
        NOT IMPLEMENTED, and structurally expensive. The relay allowlist
        is baked at nix build (relayAllowedPubkeysCsv), so publisher
        revocation needs a full rebuild — the compromise window is one
        build-deploy cycle. ADR-2027 Context. see AB-13.3

    end
    end
    Note over AG,GW: INVARIANT — a Nostr PUBLIC key is the publishable half, an identity/capability token, not a secret.<br/>Passing it as a tool argument is the intended design. The bearer token and the Nostr PRIVATE key are what never leave the box.
    Note over AG,MAIL: DIVERGENCE — this is a real, working break-glass tier with an allow-list, a fingerprinted audit line and a default-sanitised posture,<br/>which is MORE governed than the proxy break-glass bearer in AB-16.6. Neither appears in the ADR-2027 register as an implemented control.

## Audit qualification — 2026-09-07

AB-16.2 corrects an upstream comment as well as the previous drawing: Docker explicitly selected seccomp profiles override the default; they are not automatically stacked ([Docker seccomp documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/seccomp/)). No running filter or credential contents were inspected. AB-16.3 passed `check-seccomp.sh` against the current source. The same-UID custody limitation remains. See [audit](../../estate-review/2026-09-07-agentbox-audit.md).
