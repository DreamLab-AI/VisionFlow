## AB-25.2 ontology_ask — budget-bounded provenance-scoped subgraph

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant AG as Agent
    participant BR as ontology-bridge<br/>agentbox/mcp/servers/ontology-bridge.js:272
    participant RET as retrieval brain<br/>agentbox/mcp/servers/lib/ontology-retrieval.js:279
    participant BUD as ontology-budget<br/>agentbox/mcp/servers/lib/ontology-budget.js:66
    participant BE as backend<br/>Loom or VisionClaw — see AB-24

    AG->>BR: ontology_ask {query, model_tier, mode, depth, provenance, full, domain, max_tokens}
    Note over BR: model_tier enum booster | haiku | sonnet | opus default sonnet. mode enum menu | expand.<br/>provenance enum asserted | inferred default asserted (:280-289)
    BR->>RET: ask(req)
    RET->>BUD: resolveBudget(tier, max_tokens)
    Note over BUD: TIERS — booster maxTokens 80 depth 0 mode menu allowFull false — haiku 500 / 0 / menu /<br/>false — sonnet 2000 / 1 / expand / true — opus 6000 / 2 / expand / true (:14-19)
    Note over BUD: INVARIANT: an override may only LOWER the tier ceiling, never raise it — closes the<br/>discretionary-budget adversarial finding (:8, :43-49)
    alt full=true below sonnet
        BUD-->>RET: isFullAllowed false (:55-57)
        RET->>RET: full_denied = true
        Note over RET: page bodies are FORBIDDEN below sonnet by construction — and when allowed the body is<br/>chunked to at most the tier budget, closing the 93k-token leak (:11)
    end
    RET->>BE: seed then optional k-hop expand — see AB-24.3
    BE-->>RET: seeds and triples
    RET->>BUD: clampToBudget(turtle, tier, max_tokens)
    Note over BUD: estimateTokens rounds UP at ~4 chars/token so the governor errs toward UNDER-filling,<br/>never over (:31-35). Truncation appends the TRUNCATION_MARK (:22)
    BUD-->>RET: {text, tokens, truncated, budget}
    RET-->>BR: terse Turtle + breadcrumb + seed_iris + provenance
    BR-->>AG: budget-bounded provenance-scoped subgraph
    Note over AG,BR: read-pervasive and FAIL-OPEN — the tool never blocks a turn and never bloats the context<br/>window
    Note over RET: PROPOSED ADR-2073: split the Loom store into assert and inferred named graphs so seed and expand both carry<br/>a GRAPH clause and provenance is backend-enforced - until the store is split the scope is refused with an explicit<br/>limitation, never silently merged - ADR-2023 remaining is the ORIGIN of this gap, not its resolution
```

## AB-25.3 The authoring-authority gate — four modes, deny by default

```mermaid

    BR->>WR: axiomAdd(args, ctx) or propose(args, ctx)

    alt unknown or absent mode (:269)
        GATE-->>WR: throw OntologyAuthorityError code ontology_authoring_unknown_mode
        Note over GATE: DENY BY DEFAULT — an unknown or absent mode is denied and an absent manifest key reads<br/>false
    else target = shared-ontology AND mode is not governed-proposal (:277)
        GATE-->>WR: throw code ontology_shared_store_forbidden_in_local_mode
        Note over GATE: INVARIANT: the shared ontology is reachable SOLELY through governed-proposal —<br/>ontology_propose then Whelk then PR then human review
    else operation = direct-axiom-load AND mode is not governed-proposal (:285)
        GATE-->>WR: throw code ontology_direct_axiom_load_disabled
        Note over GATE: direct_axiom_load = false (agentbox.toml:656) now ACTUALLY blocks a direct axiom load in<br/>forced-local, remote-disabled and bootstrap. In governed-proposal the request is<br/>CONVERTED into a proposal rather than executed
    else mode = forced-local
        GATE->>ENV: require AGENTBOX_ONTOLOGY_LOCAL
        GATE->>ENV: require ONTOLOGY_LOCAL_AUTHORING=1
        GATE->>MAN: require skills.ontology.local_authoring = true

        end
    else mode = remote-disabled
        GATE->>ENV: require ONTOLOGY_LOCAL_AUTHORING=1 and the manifest key, MINUS the selector
        Note over GATE: INVARIANT: AN OUTAGE IS NOT AN AUTHORITY — a network failure withdraws the governed<br/>write path, it does not grant a local one (:43-45)
    else mode = bootstrap
        GATE->>ENV: require AGENTBOX_ONTOLOGY_BOOTSTRAP=1
        GATE->>ENV: require AGENTBOX_ONTOLOGY_BOOTSTRAP_AUTHORISATION reference
        GATE->>MAN: require direct_axiom_load = true
        alt any missing
            GATE-->>WR: throw code ontology_bootstrap_not_authorised
        end
        Note over GATE: ZERO-TOLERANCE class — ontology_axiom_load = "zero-tolerance" in<br/>[skills.authority.classes] (agentbox.toml:794)
    end
    GATE->>GATE: mint correlation id ont-auth-<ts>-<12 hex> at stage validation
    GATE-->>WR: authorised {mode, target, operation, correlation_id}
    WR->>HELP: write the authored page
    WR->>FM: stamp ontology-authoring-correlation / -mode / -stage into V2 frontmatter<br/>(ontology-authoring-authority.js:420-423, keys declared at :96-100)
    WR-->>BR: {authorised, mode, governed, route, correlation_id}
    Note over BR: local authoring reports governed=false so a caller can recognise the authority change<br/>before acting on the result
    Note over GATE: chain stages validation then proposal then approval then merge then served-corpus — ONE<br/>linked record rather than five unrelated events (:72-79)
```

    note for OntologyAuthorityError "A denial is an ERROR, not a return value — a caller that forgets to check cannot<br/>silently proceed. missing_authority names the EXACT authorities that were absent: never<br/>a silent no-op and never a silent write (ontology-authoring-authority.js:106-131)"
    note for MANIFEST_KEYS "RESOLVED ADR-2054 follow-on: skills.ontology.local_authoring is now DECLARED explicitly<br/>as false in agentbox.toml (was undeclared-by-absence when ADR-2054 landed) — the deny is<br/>reviewable in a diff rather than implicit in an omission (agentbox.toml:663)"

## AB-25.5 The governed promotion route

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant AG as Agent
    participant BR as ontology_propose<br/>agentbox/mcp/servers/ontology-bridge.js:407
    participant GUARD as ontology-propose guard<br/>agentbox/mcp/servers/ontology-propose.js:140
    participant VC as VisionClaw<br/>POST /api/ontology-agent/propose
    participant WHELK as Whelk consistency check<br/>see VC-20
    participant PR as Pull request
    participant H as Human reviewer
    participant CORP as served corpus

    AG->>BR: ontology_propose(body)
    BR->>GUARD: guard the write
    Note over GUARD: AGENTBOX_ONTOLOGY_DIRECT_LOAD default OFF so ontology_axiom_add refuses and REDIRECTS to<br/>the governed path (ontology-propose.js:16, :140)
    BR->>VC: governed proposal
    VC->>WHELK: consistency check
    alt inconsistent
        WHELK-->>VC: reject
        VC-->>AG: staged result with the inconsistency named
    else consistent
        WHELK-->>VC: ok
        VC->>PR: open a PR
        PR->>H: review
        alt approved
            H->>CORP: merge, then the generation is served
        else refused
            H-->>AG: no change
        end
    end
    Note over AG,CORP: INVARIANT ADR-2022: personal-KG concepts reach the shared ontology ONLY through<br/>ontology_propose then Whelk then PR then human review/merge (agentbox.toml:651-654)
    Note over GUARD: DIVERGENCE: ADR-2022 implementation_status is PARTIAL. FORCE_LOCAL dispatch precedes the<br/>remote axiom descriptor and reaches a Markdown-writing helper, so the remote default<br/>prevents an ungoverned REMOTE load but does not by itself enforce every LOCAL authoring<br/>path — that is what the AB-25.3 gate now covers
    Note over CORP: PROPOSED VisionClaw ADR-2105: the proposal, approval, merge and served-corpus stages accept, persist and echo<br/>the authoring correlation id, and a request without one is recorded as unlinked rather than given a synthetic mint<br/>ADR-2022 remaining is the ORIGIN of this gap, not its resolution
    Note over BR: RESOLVED ADR-2054: the standalone CLI now routes through createAuthoredCorpusWriter<br/>with mode forced-local, so EVERY authoring caller crosses assertAuthoringAuthority.<br/>A denial returns a typed OntologyAuthorityError result and exits non-zero — being a<br/>CLI is not an authority. The static-guard test pins the receiver as the gated writer.
```

## AB-25.6 ontology_axiom_add — the disabled backdoor

    participant MAN as agentbox.toml

        BR--xLOAD: the ungoverned POST /api/ontology/load is NEVER issued
    else bootstrap mode with every authority present
        GATE-->>HW: authorised — explicit, signed, auditable, deliberately slow
        HW->>LOAD: bulk load
    end
    Note over MAN: ontology_axiom_load = "zero-tolerance" in [skills.authority.classes]<br/>(agentbox.toml:794), commented "ungoverned KG write backdoor"
    Note over BR: INVARIANT: default off = ontology_axiom_add refuses and redirects (agentbox.toml:655).<br/>Set true only for admin/bootstrap, where a signed authorisation is required
    Note over GATE: the bootstrap authorisation reference is RECORDED, not verified, here — signature<br/>verification remains the management-api authority consumer's job (ADR-2022 remaining)
    Note over BR: routine enrichment is gated behind a PR round-trip and there is NO fast path for<br/>high-volume trusted writes, by design (ADR-2022 consequences)

## AB-25.7 Condensation index — the staleness scheduler

                SCH->>REF: exec the refresh
                Note over REF: flock-serialised — SKIPS if a refresh already holds the lock. Stages overwrite/resume<br/>deterministically, so the scheduler is idempotent
                REF->>IDX: parse the corpus into classes
                loop each KG class, max_concurrency 2 (agentbox.toml:678)

                    Note over LLM: model qwen3.8-27B style openai (agentbox.toml:676-677). The model runs BEHIND the Loom<br/>facade so it is swappable with zero change here

                SCH-->>SCH: writes NOTHING — no LLM load, no cache churn
            end
        end
    end
    Note over SCH: the refresh had NO natural trigger — nothing re-ran it when GitHubSync/elevation rewrote<br/>the corpus, so the per-turn [ONTOLOGY] breadcrumb cache silently went stale. The<br/>"triggered incrementally on sync" claim was UNWIRED (:7-13)
    Note over SCH: fail-open, and a THIN wrapper — parse, cheap-LLM pass and cache fold all stay in the<br/>refresh script (:15-16). Mirrors the ruvector-aggregate-sweep house pattern, see AB-21

    note right of Drifted
        The DRIFT GUARD. A digest compacted in an earlier turn can silently
        disagree with the corpus a later turn reasons over, so revalidate
        diffs the held digests against the live corpus rather than trusting
        carried state.

    note right of Held
        Resolution order is the repo lib first, then the baked /opt copy —
        the same pattern as ontology-local.cjs and continual-harness.cjs.

## AB-25.10 Vault path authority for ontology writes

    participant EP as entrypoint<br/>agentbox/config/entrypoint-unified.sh
    participant MAN as agentbox.toml [vault]<br/>agentbox/agentbox.toml:706

    participant CI as check-no-logseq-paths.sh<br/>agentbox/scripts/ci/check-no-logseq-paths.sh

    EP->>MAN: read [vault]
    alt no [vault] configured
        EP-->>EP: FAIL-LOUD — boot prints "[vault] disabled"
        SK-->>SK: the corpus skill disables itself with one clear line rather than writing into a stale<br/>tree
    else configured
        EP->>SK: export VAULT_ROOT / VAULT_PAGES / VAULT_FORMAT / VAULT_TUI to every supervised program,<br/>tmux window and MCP server
        Note over EP,SK: ONTOLOGY_PAGES_DIR is DERIVED from [vault] — no consumer hard-codes a corpus path, so<br/>one edit relocates the corpus for every agent surface
        SK->>SK: expand ${VAULT_ROOT} / ${VAULT_PAGES} placeholders in its own config
        SK->>FM: write the page
        FM->>FM: emit V2 YAML frontmatter — public is a real YAML boolean, wikilink values are quoted
        opt legacy leading block present
            FM->>FM: convert a legacy key-colon-colon-value block on write
        end
        FM->>FM: stamp the AB-25.3 correlation keys
    end
    CI->>CI: gate the tree against literal corpus paths
    Note over FM: INVARIANT ADR-2028: emitting a key-colon-colon-value line is a VIOLATION<br/>(VAULT-corpus-format Invariant 1). format "obsidian" is the one format writers emit —<br/>"logseq-legacy" is READ-tolerance only for an unconverted graph
    Note over SK: see AB-22 for the full skills-side vault contract
