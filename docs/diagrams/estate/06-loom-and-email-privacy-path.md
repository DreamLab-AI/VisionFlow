## ES-06.2 ask_email — tier 1, egress filter applied
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant A as agent
    participant G as email-mcp-gateway:8765
    participant R as retrieval (bge-m3)
    participant L as Loom façade
    participant M as LAN model
    participant F as gpt-oss-safeguard<br/>egress filter

    A->>G: ask_email{query, date_from?, date_to?, sender?, folder?, top_k?}
    Note over A,G: Transport auth — Authorization Bearer<br/>AGENTBOX_EMAIL_GATEWAY_TOKEN gates ANY call
    alt bearer missing or wrong
        G-->>A: 401 — re-provision the token
    else bearer ok
        G->>R: retrieve candidate messages
        R-->>G: top_k matches
        G->>L: POST /v1/chat/completions (REASONER_BASE_URL)
        L->>L: scaffold-inject the last user message (see ES-06.5)
        L->>M: delegate to the LAN model
        M-->>L: completion
        L-->>G: grounded answer
        G->>F: sanitize
        F-->>G: gist plus abstracted evidence — roles, date buckets, opaque ref_id
        G-->>A: sanitized answer, NEVER raw mail
    end
    Note over G,F: INVARIANT — ask_email ALWAYS sanitizes regardless of<br/>any pubkey passed to it. Raw data comes only from the<br/>raw tools. Default posture is to prefer this tool.
```

## ES-06.3 Break-glass tier — raw tools behind a second, capability gate
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant A as agent
    participant G as email-mcp-gateway:8765
    participant AL as PRIVILEGED_NOSTR_PUBKEYS allow-list
    participant S as message store

    A->>G: fetch_email_raw{query, nostr_pubkey} or fetch_email_by_ref{ref_id, nostr_pubkey}
    rect rgb(240,230,230)
    Note over A,G: TIER 1 — transport bearer gates any call
    alt bearer invalid
        G-->>A: 401
    else bearer valid
        Note over G,AL: TIER 2 — capability. The nostr_pubkey ARGUMENT is<br/>checked against the server allow-list. Every attempt is<br/>logged with an 8-char fingerprint.
        G->>AL: lookup pubkey
        alt pubkey on the allow-list
            AL-->>G: authorised
            G->>S: fetch raw
            S-->>G: real headers, sender, subject, date, full text
            G-->>A: RAW — egress filter BYPASSED
        else absent, empty, or npub instead of hex
            AL-->>G: not authorised
            G-->>A: {"authorized": false} and NO data
        end
    end
    end
    Note over A,AL: INVARIANT — a Nostr PUBLIC key is the publishable half,<br/>an identity/capability token, not a secret. Passing it as a<br/>tool argument is the design, not a leak. What never leaves<br/>the box is the bearer token and the Nostr PRIVATE key.
    Note over G: Read the operator pubkey from AGENTBOX_X_ONLY_PUBKEY_HEX<br/>at call time. Never hardcode the hex into skill source.
```

## ES-06.4 refresh_inbox — on-demand ingest across two Proton accounts
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant A as agent
    participant G as email-mcp-gateway:8765
    participant PB as Proton Bridge (in-container)
    participant P1 as primary IMAP_USER
    participant P2 as secondary IMAP_USER_2
    participant IX as index

    A->>G: refresh_inbox
    Note over G: Pull new mail NOW rather than waiting for the ~4h crawl.<br/>Used for password resets, one-time codes, verification links.
    G->>PB: open bridge
    loop within a time budget, primary first
        G->>P1: crawl new messages
        P1-->>G: messages
        G->>P2: crawl new messages
        P2-->>G: messages
    end
    G->>IX: ingest and embed
    IX-->>G: indexed
    G-->>A: newest messages plus accounts_crawled[]
    Note over G,P2: A third slot IMAP_USER_3 exists but is EMPTY.<br/>The scheduled crawl logs "IMAP ingest complete across<br/>2/2 account(s)".
    Note over A,G: DIVERGENCE — a 180 s refresh_inbox timeout is the<br/>signature of a stale reasoning route, NOT a dead<br/>container. see ES-06.7
```

## ES-06.5 Loom scaffold-inject — grounding, budget clamp and the confidence gate
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant C as consumer
    participant F as loom-facade
    participant IX as scaffold + prose index<br/>ontology-corpus.rvdb
    participant XI as xinference /v1/embeddings
    participant B as DISTILL_BACKEND_URL

    C->>F: POST /v1/chat/completions
    F->>IX: lexical match on the last user message
    IX-->>F: scored matches
    opt LOOM_SEMANTIC_FALLBACK=1
        F->>XI: embed query (bge-small-en-v1.5 / 384)
        XI-->>F: vector
        F->>IX: semantic fallback
        Note over F,IX: DIVERGENCE — gated OFF by default (=0) until the<br/>recall bench clears (loom RUST-ARCHITECTURE 8.4)
    end
    alt LOOM_CONFIDENCE_INJECTION=1
        F->>F: apply the gate
        Note over F: LOOM_STRONG_MATCH_SCORE 8.0 — at/above gives full budget<br/>and is the confidence denominator<br/>LOOM_MIN_INJECT_SCORE 2.0 — below skips injection entirely<br/>LOOM_MIN_INJECT_FRACTION 0.4 — weakest kept match's budget share
    else LOOM_CONFIDENCE_INJECTION=0 (default Profile B)
        F->>F: master switch OFF, thresholds pinned at loom-scaffold tuning.rs defaults
    end
    F->>F: clamp scaffold to ONTOLOGY_BUDGET (1500 tokens)
    alt DISTILL_BACKEND_URL set
        F->>B: delegate with the injected scaffold
        Note over F,B: LOOM_MIN_MAX_TOKENS = 1536 — reasoning backends<br/>truncate to EMPTY below this (the 400-to-empty trap)
        B-->>F: completion
        F-->>C: grounded completion
    else DISTILL_BACKEND_URL blank
        F-->>C: 503 — retrieval-only deployment
    end
    Note over C,B: BENCHMARK — static scaffold lifts grounded recall ~3.5x and<br/>is ~3-6x faster than cold parametric reasoning. Prose adds<br/>~nothing and was dropped as a default. Agentic tool-traversal<br/>is model-dependent (Gemma strong, Muse weak).
    Note over F: The four confidence vars are stated EXPLICITLY in compose so<br/>/health.injection_policy can be diffed against the file. The<br/>2026-09-02 dream cycle found a doc/deploy mismatch caused<br/>precisely by leaving them unstated (loom ADR-138).

## ES-06.7 The black-hole hang — health green, every reasoning call stalls

    DEAD--xG: no response
    G-->>A: 180 s timeout / whole-session tool loss
    end
    Note over A,DEAD: FINGERPRINT is exactly that split — health GREEN,<br/>all reasoning calls stall. The fix is the ROUTE, not<br/>the container. Do not restart the gateway.
    rect rgb(230,240,230)
    Note over A,GOOD: FIXED STATE

    G-->>A: answer
    end
    Note over GOOD: VERIFY — curl http 192.168.2.132:8084/v1/models returns<br/>the real model list (currently Qwen3.8-27B). Match it to the<br/>CURRENT backend rather than a fixed string, then recreate<br/>the container.
```

## ES-06.8 MCP client link loss and the mid-session JSON-RPC recovery
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant CC as Claude Code MCP client
    participant G as email-mcp-gateway:8765
    participant M as cold LAN model

    rect rgb(240,230,230)
    Note over CC,M: FAILURE — tools absent for the WHOLE session
    CC->>G: initialize handshake at session start
    G->>M: warm the backend
    M-->>G: slow (30s+ per call, SSE held open)
    Note over CC,G: The client disables an HTTP/SSE server for the ENTIRE<br/>session when the startup initialize exceeds MCP_TIMEOUT,<br/>and it does NOT retry HTTP servers after boot.
    G--xCC: handshake exceeds MCP_TIMEOUT
    CC-->>CC: server disabled for the session
    end
    Note over CC,G: DURABLE FIX (in the build, applied on next nix buildout) —<br/>MCP_TIMEOUT=60000 and MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT=180000 set in<br/>flake.nix, tunable via [skills.email_search]<br/>.mcp_startup_timeout_ms / .mcp_tool_timeout_ms, plus a<br/>detached boot warm-up in config/entrypoint-unified.sh.
    rect rgb(230,240,230)
    Note over CC,G: MID-SESSION RECOVERY — verified 2026-07-06
    CC->>G: POST $AGENTBOX_EMAIL_GATEWAY_URL/mcp — initialize
    Note over CC,G: Authorization Bearer $AGENTBOX_EMAIL_GATEWAY_TOKEN<br/>Accept application/json, text/event-stream

    CC->>G: notifications/initialized (with Mcp-Session-Id)
    CC->>G: tools/call
    G-->>CC: result
    end
    Note over CC,M: INVARIANT — the container itself never went down. Only<br/>the harness client link did, so driving the streamable-HTTP<br/>server directly over JSON-RPC restores the capability.
