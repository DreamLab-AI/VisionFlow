    else num_constraints == 0
        Note over EX: bit CLEARS - required, or force_pass_kernel keeps walking a buffer that no longer describes anything (force_channels.rs:560-562)
    end
    Note over CA,EX: INVARIANT ADR-2029 - enablement is owned by residency, never by settings
    Note over OCA: class_id, class_charge and class_mass are uploaded as separate per-node device buffers and passed to force_pass_kernel, not carried in SimParams

    Note over K: pinned nodes SKIP integration so they hold position, but STILL exert forces on neighbours
    WS->>FCA: UploadPositions :3303 for a dragged node's new location
    Note over FCA: ResetPositions :3894 clears the layout and sets reheat_factor = 1.0 :3969

## VC-11.7 Semantic forces and stress majorization

```mermaid

    Note over SFA: DAG radial bias is SELF-GATED on dag_bias_k > 0 with dag_level_distance - it has no feature-flag bit (force_channels.rs:34-36)
    alt GPU absent
        Note over SFA: CPU fallback implementations exist :221
    end
    PS->>SMA: TriggerStressMajorization :315
    alt no GPU context
        Note over SMA: returns Err "GPU not available for stress majorization" :95 - hard failure, no CPU degradation

        SMA->>FCA: TriggerStressMajorization :3724
        FCA->>FCA: GetStressMajorizationStats :3736, ResetStressMajorizationSafety :3752
    end
    Note over SMA,FCA: DIVERGENCE bit5 ENABLE_STRESS_MAJORIZATION is declared but never set by derive_dispatch_feature_flags - stress majorization is not a GPU force channel
    Note over SMA,FCA: Stress majorization params live on CPU in SemanticProcessorActor and are absent from GPU SimParams - src/models/simulation_params.rs:77
    Note over SMA,FCA: DIVERGENCE bit3 ENABLE_TEMPORAL_COHERENCE is likewise declared but never set - both are reserved bits, not wired force terms

## VC-11.8 Layout mode switch — post-ADR-2055

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant C as Client
    participant API as layout_handler<br/>src/handlers/layout_handler.rs
    participant FCA as ForceComputeActor<br/>force_compute_actor.rs:2641

    C->>API: POST /layout/mode with a mode string
    API->>API: parse into LayoutMode
    alt mode does not parse
        Note over API: RESOLVED ADR-2055 - returns 400 ErrorBadRequest naming the accepted values. It previously coerced silently to ForceDirected, turning a client error into a wrong-looking-right result
    else parsed
        API->>FCA: SetLayoutMode :2641
        FCA->>FCA: apply mode on the live UnifiedGPUCompute path
        FCA->>FCA: reheat_factor = max(reheat_factor, 1.5) :2849 on UpdateSimulationParams
    end
    C->>API: POST /layout/radial
    API->>FCA: SetRadialLayout :2730
    Note over API: RESOLVED ADR-2055 - the advertised mode list is now five (forceDirected, hierarchical, radial, spectral, temporal). Clustered is excluded because ForceComputeActor has no dedicated arm for it and it is indistinguishable from ForceDirected
    Note over FCA: Evidence for the exclusion - the CUDA layout_mode field is never read in the .cu, only dag_bias_k and layer_bias_k are, and those are primed only for Radial and Hierarchical
    Note over API,FCA: REMOVED ADR-2055 - the five-engine physics-v2 LayoutEngine registry (engine_for, src/physics/engines/) is deleted along with the Cargo feature. Its step() bodies were stubs and it was never in a shipped build, so no participant for it remains here

## VC-11.9 Warmup, settle and reheat cycle

```mermaid

    [*] --> Warmup
    Warmup: Stability warmup - stability_warmup_remaining decremented each tick at line 2007
    Active: Integrating - mean per-node KE at or above SETTLE_KE_EPSILON
    Settling: Consecutive sub-epsilon ticks accumulating in settle_stable_frames
    Settled: is_settled true - reported via GetSettlementState line 3607
    Reheated: reheat_factor greater than 0 - velocity perturbation injected

    Warmup --> Active: warmup frames exhausted
    Active --> Settling: next_stable_frames increments when mean_ke finite and below epsilon line 450-456
    Settling --> Active: KE at or above epsilon resets the run to 0 line 495
    Settling --> Settled: settle_stable_frames reaches SETTLE_FRAME_THRESHOLD
    Active --> Settled: paused latch - orchestrator declared an energy plateau line 470
    Settled --> Reheated: settings change, pin, or reset raises reheat_factor
    Reheated --> Active: decay to zero
    Reheated --> Reheated: reheat_factor multiplied by 0.997 each step line 2103
