# Community Detection Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented GPU-accelerated community detection using label propagation algorithm integrated with the existing VisionFlow unified compute system.

## Implementation Details

### 1. CUDA Kernels Added (visionflow_unified.cu)
- `init_labels_kernel`: Initialize each node with unique label
- `propagate_labels_sync_kernel`: Synchronous label propagation with weighted voting
- `propagate_labels_async_kernel`: Asynchronous label propagation with in-place updates  
- `check_convergence_kernel`: Check if labels changed between iterations
- `compute_modularity_kernel`: Calculate modularity quality metric
- `init_random_states_kernel`: Initialize random states for tie-breaking
- `compute_node_degrees_kernel`: Calculate node degrees for modularity
- `count_community_sizes_kernel`: Count nodes in each community
- `relabel_communities_kernel`: Compact community labels (remove gaps)

### 2. UnifiedGPUCompute Extensions
Added new device buffers:
```rust
pub labels_current: DeviceBuffer<i32>,        // Current node labels
pub labels_next: DeviceBuffer<i32>,           // Next iteration labels (sync mode)
pub label_counts: DeviceBuffer<i32>,          // Label frequency counts
pub convergence_flag: DeviceBuffer<i32>,      // Convergence check flag
pub node_degrees: DeviceBuffer<f32>,          // Node degrees for modularity
pub modularity_contributions: DeviceBuffer<f32>, // Per-node modularity
pub community_sizes: DeviceBuffer<i32>,       // Size of each community
pub label_mapping: DeviceBuffer<i32>,         // For relabeling communities
pub rand_states: DeviceBuffer<curandState>,   // Random states for tie-breaking
```

Added main function:
```rust
pub fn run_community_detection(
    &mut self, 
    max_iterations: u32, 
    synchronous: bool, 
    seed: u32
) -> Result<(Vec<i32>, usize, f32, u32, Vec<i32>, bool)>
```

### 3. Message System Integration
Added new message types in `messages.rs`:
- `CommunityDetectionResult`: Results with labels, modularity, etc.
- `CommunityDetectionParams`: Algorithm parameters
- `CommunityDetectionAlgorithm`: Enum for algorithm types
- `RunCommunityDetection`: Message to trigger community detection

### 4. Actor System Integration  
Added `Handler<RunCommunityDetection>` to `GPUComputeActor` following the same pattern as K-means and anomaly detection handlers.

## Algorithm Features

### Label Propagation Algorithm
- **Synchronous Mode**: All nodes update simultaneously using double-buffering
- **Asynchronous Mode**: Nodes update in-place with potential race conditions (faster convergence)
- **Weighted Edges**: Uses CSR edge weights for weighted voting
- **Tie Breaking**: Random selection when multiple labels have equal votes
- **Early Stopping**: Convergence detection in synchronous mode

### Quality Metrics
- **Modularity**: Standard community quality measure Q = (1/2m) * Σ[A_ij - (k_i*k_j)/(2m)] * δ(c_i,c_j)
- **Community Sizes**: Track size of each detected community
- **Convergence**: Boolean flag indicating if algorithm converged

### Performance Optimizations
- **Shared Memory**: Use shared memory for label frequency counting
- **Atomic Operations**: Efficient community size counting and convergence checks
- **Compact Labeling**: Remove gaps in community labels for efficient storage
- **GPU Parallelization**: Each thread processes one node in parallel

## Integration Points

### With Existing Systems
- Uses existing CSR graph representation (edge_row_offsets, edge_col_indices, edge_weights)
- Integrates with spatial grid system for potential neighborhood-based optimizations
- Compatible with constraint system and SSSP for multi-modal analysis
- Follows same buffer management patterns as K-means and anomaly detection

### Memory Management
- Dynamic buffer allocation based on number of nodes
- Efficient memory usage with buffer reuse
- GPU memory tracking and management

## Usage Example
```rust
// Through actor system
let params = CommunityDetectionParams {
    algorithm: CommunityDetectionAlgorithm::LabelPropagation,
    max_iterations: 100,
    convergence_tolerance: 0.001,
    synchronous: true,
    seed: 42,
};

let result = gpu_actor.send(RunCommunityDetection { params }).await?;
// Returns: node_labels, num_communities, modularity, iterations, community_sizes, converged
```
