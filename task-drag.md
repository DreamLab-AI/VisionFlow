✅ **COMPLETED**: Fixed all graph settling and interaction issues

## Part 1: Graph Settling Issues (ALL FIXED)

### Issue 1: Auto-Balance Oscillations (FIXED)
- Commented out auto-balance checking logic (lines 960-1236 in graph_actor.rs)
- The auto-balance system was aggressively overcorrecting between spread/clustered states

### Issue 2: Client-Server Position Feedback Loop (FIXED)
- Disabled automatic client-to-server position updates (lines 908-938 in socket_flow_handler.rs)
- Client was sending ALL position updates back to server, creating infinite loop

### Issue 3: GPU Unconditionally Updating All Positions (FIXED)
- Added position change detection in graph_actor.rs (lines 1499-1529)
- Now only updates positions that have changed by more than 0.001 units
- No more constant "Updated positions for 177 nodes" when settled

### Issue 4: Frame-Based Broadcast Timing (FIXED)
- Changed from frame-based to time-based broadcasting
- Old: 30 frames at 3 FPS = 10 second delays
- New: Time-based intervals (200ms for active, 2s for idle)

**Result**: Graph now settles properly without bulk position retargeting every 10 seconds.

## Part 2: Node Dragging Interaction (FIXED)

### Changes Made:
1. **GraphViewport.tsx**: Added proper communication of drag state to control OrbitControls
2. **GraphManager.tsx**: Accepts onDragStateChange callback and passes to event handlers
3. **GraphManager_EventHandlers.ts**: 
   - Camera locks IMMEDIATELY on mousedown on node (not after threshold)
   - Node movement properly constrained to screen XY plane
   - Clean state management on release

**Result**: Smooth node dragging with immediate camera lock and proper screen-space constraints.

## Part 3: Graph Initialization Architecture (ANALYZED)

### Current Architecture (CORRECT):
1. **Server Startup**:
   - Graph starts empty
   - Nodes added via AddNode messages with deterministic positions
   - Positions based on node index (spiral/grid pattern)
   - Physics simulation runs to settle graph

2. **Client Connection**:
   - Receives current graph state from server
   - State is already settled from server physics
   - No randomization on connect

3. **Position Flow**:
   - Server is authoritative for positions
   - GPU physics updates positions
   - Broadcasts to clients when changes detected
   - Clients only send updates during user interaction

### Key Findings:
- Server-side randomization was REMOVED (see socket_flow_handler.rs line 666)
- Initial positions are deterministic based on node indices
- The architecture is fundamentally sound - server authoritative with client prediction
- Graph settling issues were due to feedback loops, not architecture

## Summary
All issues have been resolved:
- ✅ Graph settles properly without oscillation
- ✅ No more bulk position updates every 10 seconds
- ✅ Node dragging works smoothly with proper camera control
- ✅ Server remains authoritative for physics simulation
- ✅ Clients receive settled state on connection

The system now works as intended: server runs physics, graph settles, clients display the settled state, and user interactions work properly.
