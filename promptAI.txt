our client code is in client directory and is typescript. Rust server code is in src and should have no typescript files. You can use tree to understand the project. TS client uses camelCase, the API calls use burger-case and the rust back end uses snake_case. The settings.toml across the project resides on the server and is mounted by the docker volume. Cloudflared tunnel in a docker handles the production end point and connects to exposed port 4000 on the webxr docker which is then proxied through nginx inside the container.
