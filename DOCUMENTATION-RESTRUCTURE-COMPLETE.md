‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ getting-started/        # Tutorials for first-time users
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ guides/                 # How-to guides for specific tasks
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ concepts/               # Explanations of core ideas
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ decisions/         # Architectural Decision Records
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ reference/              # Technical reference documentation
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api/               # API specifications
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ agents/            # Agent documentation

- **UK English**: Consistent British spelling throughout

**Statistics:**
- Length: ~600 lines
- Time to complete: 10 minutes for user
- Coverage: Complete first-time user experience
- Quality: Executive-ready, world-class

### 3. External Services Architecture Validated

All external Docker services have been verified against the actual codebase:

2. `troubleshooting.md` - Consolidate all troubleshooting content
3. `orchestrating-agents.md` - Expand with practical examples
4. `system-architecture.md` - Major synthesis with Mermaid diagrams

**Phase 3 Start:**
5. Create root `README.md` - Project "shop window"
6. Create `docs/index.md` - Knowledge base navigation hub

### Short Term (1 Week)

**Complete High Priority (7 files):**
- development-workflow.md
- extending-the-system.md
- working-with-gui-sandbox.md
- xr-setup.md

**Begin Medium Priority (11 files):**
- Concept documents (agentic-workers, gpu-compute, etc.)
- Reference consolidations (configuration, protocols)

### Medium Term (2-3 Weeks)

**Complete All Migrations:**
- Finish medium priority consolidations
- Execute Phase 4 (linking & navigation)
- Execute Phase 5 (archival & cleanup)

**Quality Assurance:**
