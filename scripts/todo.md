Inconsistent Settings Handling: The README.md describes a settings inheritance model (Unauthenticated, Authenticated, Power Users) that is partially implemented in the Rust code (feature_access.rs) but not fully reflected in the client-side settings management. The client-side SettingsStore doesn't seem to be aware of user roles or server-side settings inheritance.


Missing Client-Side Authentication: The README.md and Rust code describe Nostr authentication, but there's no corresponding implementation in the provided client-side code. The NostrAuthService.ts is present but not integrated into a full authentication flow.

Missing Error Handling: The client-side code lacks robust error handling. Many asynchronous operations (e.g., fetch, WebSocket communication) don't have proper catch blocks or error reporting mechanisms.

Missing State Management: The client-side code uses a mix of global variables (e.g., graphDataManager), singletons (e.g., SettingsStore), and event emitters. A more structured approach to state management (e.g., using a state management library like Zustand or Redux) would improve maintainability.

Missing Type Definitions: Many of the TypeScript files lack complete type definitions, especially for data fetched from the server. This makes it difficult to understand the structure of the data and can lead to runtime errors.

Missing Comments and Documentation: The code lacks sufficient comments and JSDoc/TSDoc documentation to explain its purpose and functionality.

Redundant Scene Initialization: The SceneManager is a singleton, but the App class also seems to have some scene-related properties. This could be simplified.

Inconsistent Use of static: The SceneManager uses a static getInstance method, while other singletons (e.g., SettingsStore) don't. This should be consistent.


Inconsistent use of web::Data: The nostr_service is wrapped in web::Data in app_state.rs, but the feature_access is also wrapped in web::Data and then accessed directly. This should be consistent.

Inconsistent use of Arc<RwLock<>>: Some shared state is wrapped in Arc<RwLock<>> (e.g., settings), while others are not (e.g., feature_access). This should be consistent.

Missing Send trait implementation: The main.rs file mentions issues with the Send trait, indicating potential problems with asynchronous task management.

Unclear Shutdown Logic: The GraphService::shutdown() method is implemented, but it's not clear how it's used in the overall application lifecycle.

Inconsistent Error Handling: The Rust code uses a mix of Result, anyhow, and thiserror. This should be standardized.

Inconsistent Use of unwrap_or_default(): The code frequently uses unwrap_or_default() without checking if the default value is actually valid. This can lead to unexpected behavior.

Missing Validation: The Settings::merge() method in config/mod.rs doesn't validate the incoming JSON value, which could lead to invalid settings being applied.

Missing Rate Limiting: The GitHubClient doesn't implement proper rate limiting, which could lead to the application being blocked by GitHub.

Inconsistent Use of Logging: The logging level is configured in settings.yaml, but the code also uses hardcoded log levels (e.g., info!, debug!). This should be consistent.

Missing Documentation for Binary Protocol: The utils/binary_protocol.rs file implements a custom binary protocol, but there's no documentation explaining the format.

Missing Error Handling in socket_flow_handler.rs: The code doesn't handle errors from tungstenite properly.

Inconsistent Use of debug!: The code uses debug! logging in many places, even when debug mode is not enabled. This should be conditional.

Missing Documentation for compute_forces.cu and compute_forces.ptx: These files implement the GPU-accelerated physics simulation, but there's no documentation explaining how they work.

Missing Tests for compute_forces.cu and compute_forces.ptx: These files lack unit tests.


Missing Error Handling in main.rs: The code doesn't handle errors from service initialization properly.

Inconsistent Use of Arc and RwLock: The AppState uses Arc<RwLock<>> for some fields, but not for others. This should be consistent.


Missing Documentation for models: The data models lack documentation explaining their purpose and fields.


Missing Documentation for services: The service modules lack documentation explaining their purpose and functionality.


Missing Documentation for types: The type definitions lack documentation explaining their purpose and fields.


Missing Documentation for utils: The utility modules lack documentation explaining their purpose and functionality.


Inconsistent Error Handling in Client Code: The client-side code uses a mix of console.error, logger.error, and throwing errors. This should be standardized.

Missing Error Handling for WebSocket Events: The WebSocketService doesn't handle all possible WebSocket events (e.g., onclose, onerror).

Missing Error Handling for Fetch API Calls: The client-side code doesn't handle errors from fetch calls properly.
