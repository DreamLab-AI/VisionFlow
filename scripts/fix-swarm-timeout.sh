echo "1. ClaudeFlowActor is not responding to messages"
echo "2. The initialize_swarm handler hangs on actor.send()"
echo "3. MCP health endpoints are not registered (404)"

echo "   docker-compose restart"
echo "   This will reinitialize all actors"

echo -e "\n${GREEN}2. Check if ClaudeFlowActor is conditional:${NC}"
echo "   The actor might only initialize if CLAUDE_FLOW_HOST is set"
echo "   Your env shows: CLAUDE_FLOW_HOST=powerdev âœ“"

echo -e "\n${GREEN}3. Temporary workaround - Use mock data:${NC}"
echo "   Since MCP_RELAY_FALLBACK_TO_MOCK=true is set,"
echo "   the system should fall back to mock data if MCP fails"

echo -e "\n${YELLOW}Testing if restart helps:${NC}"
echo "After restarting, the initialization should either:"
echo "- Work (if ClaudeFlowActor initializes properly)"
echo "- Return immediately with mock data (if actor fails)"
echo "- But NOT hang indefinitely"

echo -e "\n${YELLOW}The hanging suggests:${NC}"
echo "- ClaudeFlowActor was created (claude_flow_addr is Some)"
echo "- But the actor is deadlocked or crashed"
echo "- The send() waits forever for a response"
