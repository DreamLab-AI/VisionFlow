[Industry status]

## Metadata
[Standard]
```

**Total**: 78/100

- Use as templates for new content
- Reference in style guide

### 2. Adopt Strengths from Each Exemplar
- **From AI Alignment**: Accessibility + rigor balance
- **From Avatar Behavior**: Narrative flow
- **From Blockchain**: Historical context and critical analysis
- **From Rich Media files**: Visual enhancement

### 3. Systematic Improvement Path
- **Phase 1 (Critical)**: Complete or remove stubs (40 files)
- **Phase 2 (High)**: Fix copy-paste errors (67 files)
- **Phase 3 (Medium)**: Expand minimal files to acceptable (43 files)
- **Phase 4 (Ongoing)**: Elevate acceptable to good (77 files)

### 4. Domain-Specific Strategies
- **Robotics**: Urgent stub completion, many low-hanging fruit
- **AI**: Maintain quality, expand thin technical files
- **Blockchain**: Add narrative to technical-only files
- **Metaverse**: Expand systematically, maintain quality
- **Telecollaboration**: Major expansion needed (6 → 50+ files)

### 5. Quality Assurance Process
- New files must score ≥ 60 before merge
- Peer review against exemplars
