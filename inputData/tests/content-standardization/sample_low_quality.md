## Technical Overview

Blockchain is a technology for storing data.

## What is Blockchain?

Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology. It was created for Bitcoin but now has many uses.

The main idea is that data is organized in blocks that are chained together. Each block has a hash of the previous block.

This makes it hard to change old data because you would have to change all the blocks.

Some companies are using blockchain for:
* Supply chain
* Finance
* Healthcare

It's a very popular technology right now.
