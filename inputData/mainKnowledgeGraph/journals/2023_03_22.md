- Other. The text is a description of a new product called the "Meta 2" which is a headset that allows users to interact with a computer using their hands.
- This text describes a system for reconstructing 3D avatars from videos in uncontrolled settings, i.e. "in the wild." The system is Self-supervised, meaning that it does not require labeled data, and uses scene decomposition to break the video down into manageable chunks. The objective is to create a realistic, life-like avatar that can be used for a variety of purposes.Category: machine learning
- The article discusses the ethical implications of using machine learning algorithms to generate art. While some see this as a powerful way to create new and interesting works of art, others worry about the potential for misuse and abuse of these technologies.
- Some experts are predicting that the [[Metaverse and Telecollaboration]], a shared online space where users can interact with each other and [[digital objects]], will eventually replace the internet as we know it.
- Other. The text describes a study by the University of Cambridge which found that people tend to [[Privacy, Trust and Safety]] robots more when they look and behave like humans.
