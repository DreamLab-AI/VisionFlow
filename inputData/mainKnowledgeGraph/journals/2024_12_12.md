	- Just when you thought the Google news was over, there's more! Android XR is officially official – the Gemini era is coming to VR headsets & AR glasses. Here's the latest, w/o the hype. Let's get into it
		- • New XR operating system from Google
		- • Samsung building first device (Project Moohan)
		- • Full Gemini integration (e.g. circle to search)
		- • Launch partners: Sony, XREAL (woot!), Lynx, Magic Leap
	- Creates instant competition for both Apple Vision Pro AND Meta's Quest lineup.
	- Google's bringing:
		- • Full Android app ecosystem
		- • AI-first approach (Gemini built-in from day one)
		- • Open platform for developers (OpenXR + WebXR)
	- The competitive landscape
		- • Apple: $3.5K Vision Pro, but few apps and awful AI
		- • Meta: Killer headset + good AI, but dependent on Android
		- • Google: Android OEMs + Gemini everywhere + billion user apps
	- It is thus no surprise that Meta is making moves of their own
	- The highest instantiation of a JARVIS-like assistant will be glasses, not your phone. Suddenly the focus on Gemini 2.0 Flash makes total sense -- they're crucial for giving XR devices low latency smarts.
