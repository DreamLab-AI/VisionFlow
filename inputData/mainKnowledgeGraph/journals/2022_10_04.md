- Structure tips TL;DR
- This is absolutely the most important one.
  Here I clearly describe the subject, without complex jargon or words.
  Keep this short, concise, and direct to your subject
- Instead of creating a very long phrase, break this into 2.
  The first line is the key one, and in the second one you can reiterate making the subject stand even more
- Every subject requires specific words, use your imagination and go wild.
  It won't hurt using interesting words, but avoid adding 1000 of them. It won't make the image any better (actually will mess up with your prompt
- In the last section, I keep the aspect ratio, resolution, quality, stylized, and so on. You can add these in the beginning but I prefer to keep my structure very simple and clean
  You see, you don't need much more. Literally 3/4 sections.
