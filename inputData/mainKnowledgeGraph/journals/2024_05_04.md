	  isolate, reword, and present the facts, assertions, speculations, analysis and similar as narrative points, summarising appropriately into sections which reference projects and companies but not the interlocutors in the transcript. This will convert the transcript into a rich technical summary document which encapsulates all of the nuance and detail in minimal logseq markdown which uses # now * formatting. The sections should be built around a structure of your choices as the transcript moves back and forth across the details.
