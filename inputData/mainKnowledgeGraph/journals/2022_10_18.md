- Voice controlled assisted creation
- Summary: An AI-based design assistant developed by Twitter user Progen, combining Stable Diffusion for image generation, OpenAI's Whisper for voice to text translation, and GPT-3 for dialogues. The assistant can interpret spoken instructions for image ideas and includes avatar creation using Metahuman Creator. A proof of concept for future human-computer interactions. [#Voice]

- Text based real time image manipulation
- Summary: 'Imagic' is a method for text-guided semantic editing of single real images, introduced in a research paper. It enables sophisticated non-rigid edits on a single real image using only one input image and a target text, preserving the original image's structure and composition. [#Digital objects]

- Google prompt to prompt image remodeller
- Summary: The Prompt-to-Prompt project on GitHub provides an implementation over Latent Diffusion and Stable Diffusion models for image editing. It includes notebooks with examples of various prompt edits like replacement, refinement, and re-weight. The project also introduces null-text inversion for intuitive text-based editing of real images using Stable Diffusion. [#Digital objects]
