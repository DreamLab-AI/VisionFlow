	- Base image : Flux + a Lora of my face on ComfyUI ([https://lnkd.in/e4zrNQUP](https://lnkd.in/e4zrNQUP))
	- Base voice : XTTSv2 fork (Dev branch [https://lnkd.in/e5Cc4MPR](https://lnkd.in/e5Cc4MPR) )
	- Face cropped using Irfanview (just crop it with anything you want, leave some space around the head for later step)
	- Animated using latest AI Hallo2 in standard resolution mode, I don't like the plastic effect of Codeformer used for the HD outputs ([https://lnkd.in/eGnZHD8V](https://lnkd.in/eGnZHD8V))
	- Placed back the talking head above the generated image in Davinci Resolve, adjusted a bit the hue/saturation/gamma that drifted a bit in the animation process, and blurred the sides of the video for a better fusion. I also added a bit of optical flow and vectorial motion blur for a smooth 24->30fps output
	- Boosted video quality using latest FaceFusion (Next branch [https://lnkd.in/eY8yscTb](https://lnkd.in/eY8yscTb) ) through face enhancing using GFPGAN at 60% and frame enhancing using RealESRGAN at 80%
