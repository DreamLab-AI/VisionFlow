- Token Classifiers
	- llamagaurd 2, rubbish, with nvidia aegis slightly better
	- llamagaurd 3 is terrible and inefficient (1 rule at a time, only 4 available)
	- shield gemma, faster but misclassification and inconsistent
	- roberta toxicity = good and fast
	- unitary toxicity = best
	- dslim's ner, are all just average, honestly Reuters tooling from 10+ years ago (open calais) was way better -
	- bert large performs best tbh,
	- distilbert isn't as accurate
