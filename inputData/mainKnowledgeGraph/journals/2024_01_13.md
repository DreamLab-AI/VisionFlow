- Remote browse using squid
	- install http proxy application on the headless server - squid works well
	- ```
	  sudo apt-get install squid -y
	  ```
	- 2.) from your GUI computer connect to your headless server using the ssh -CNT2gL command like this: (3128 is the port number that squid or the http-proxy is running on the headless server)
	- ```
	  ssh -CNT2gL 8080:localhost:3128 username@headless-server -p 22
	  ```
	- 3.) Now port 8080 on your computer is listening to port 3128 on your headless server.
	- 4.) configure your browser to use localhost:8080 as a proxy server. Now using your web-browser you should be able to connect to any port listening for http/https running on the headless server using the address
