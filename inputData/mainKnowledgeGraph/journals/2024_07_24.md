- [[]]The EFF discusses how [[Privacy, Trust and Safety]] Badger opts users out of Google's Privacy Sandbox, which is intended to replace third-party cookies with a new tracking system in Chrome. Despite its claims of enhanced privacy, Privacy Sandbox is critiqued for shifting tracking control from third-party to Google, thereby reinforcing Google's dominance in online advertising. The feature allows advertisers to continue targeting individuals based on their browsing behaviour, raising concerns about privacy despite Google's reassurances. Privacy Badger updates Chrome settings to disable three key Privacy Sandbox features: "Ad topics," which tracks users' interests; "Site-suggested ads," facilitating retargeting; and "Ad measurement," which lets advertisers build profiles based on interactions. The article encourages users to install Privacy Badger to protect their privacy online and points out that Privacy Sandbox has been found inadequate in achieving its purported privacy goals, thereby questioning the integrity of Google's privacy efforts.

- [[]]The **jeasonstudio/runestone** repository on GitHub provides a JavaScript implementation of the **Ordinals runestone**, allowing users to interact with [[Bitcoin]] transaction outputs. It supports the parsing and creation of runestones, which are special data formats embedded in transactions, based on the **ord** protocol version 0.18.3. Key features include:
	- Installation instructions via **npm**, **pnpm**, or **yarn**.
	- Examples of how to **decipher** and **encipher** runestones, showcasing code snippets to work with transaction outputs and create new runestones and transfer them.
	- A simple API for integrating **Runestone** functionalities directly in web browsers using **ESM (ECMAScript Modules)** syntax.
	- The project is licensed under the **MIT [[license]]** and features contributions in **Rust**, **HTML**, and **JavaScript**.
	- The repository comprises folders for source code, workflows, documentation, and various examples demonstrating its usage.
