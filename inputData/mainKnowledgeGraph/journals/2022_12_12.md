- Games is the main convergence: from globalblock ""More companies are entering the [[Metaverse and Telecollaboration]] as global electronics giant Sony has announced their own [[Metaverse and Telecollaboration]] push in the latest annual corporate strategy meeting. Sony said this will be a more focused approach, as they aim to use [[Metaverse and Telecollaboration]]-inspired experiences to engage users. As Sony owns PlayStation Brands, one of the biggest install userbases in the world, they are in an amazing position to make an impact. They have also revealed that prior investments in Epic, makers of the Fortnite game, and Bungie, another gaming studio, are part of this push."

  Souls can be used as a natural way for artists to stake their reputation on their works.
  When issuing an NFT, an artist can issue it from their Soul.

  By viewing the SBTs in an artistÂs Soul, buyers can confirm the Soul belongs to the artist, thereby confirming the NFTs legitimacy.
  Additionally, artists could issue an SBT in their Soul that attests to the NFTÂs membership to a collection & vouches for its scarcity.
  Souls would thus create a verifiable, on-chain way to stake and build reputation on the provenance and scarcity of an object.
  This can go beyond art. Souls can be used for services, rentals, and any market built on scarcity, reputation, or authenticity.
  There is no method for establishing reputation for web3 identities.
  SBTs that represent [[Education and AI]] credentials, work history, previous loans, and rental contracts could serve as a persistent record of credit relevant history.

  So far, web3 has largely relied on token sales or airdrops to summon new communities.
  SBTs offer a radical improvement called ÂsouldropsÂ.
  Using SBTs, a DAO that wants to form a community within a specific L1 can souldrop to devs who hold 3/5 conference attendance SBTs, or other tokens reflecting attendance like POAPs.
