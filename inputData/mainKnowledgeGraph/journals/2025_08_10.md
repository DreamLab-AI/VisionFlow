- agent asset ontologies for [[Metaverse Ontology]]
	- i want to make contextual ontologies as assets
	- so, like 1 of 10 encoded complete themeatic and governance structures for an online space... that an agent can use to run effectively an 'endorsed' immersive environment
	- like... I dunno, Nike endorsed secondlife space, but there can only be five instances and all the schema for vibes (tech stack independant) is encoded in the asset
	- anyone can run and monetise it, but they would have to buy it
	- or... Beatles theme EMI ruleset spared digital space. Market decides winner and losers and tech stack, but the ontology in the asset sets the rules
