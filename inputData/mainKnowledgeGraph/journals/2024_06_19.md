- Smart TVs that [track what people watch](https://www.notus.org/2024-election/streaming-tv-campaign-ads) and how they watch it give political campaigns a new trove of data to exploit, with little transparency on how it's happening. Campaigns can now target viewers with specific ads based on their television habits, raising [[Cryptography]] concerns. The use of streaming TV data by firms like MiQ has revolutionized [[Politics, Law, Privacy]] advertising strategies, allowing for more targeted messaging. MiQ has worked with major campaigns like those of former Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, and President Joe Biden.
