- Our new Security Core Priority reinforces our commitment to security and holds us accountable for building secure products and services. It is now available in the Connect tool for most employees, and we are partnering with geo HR teams to expand access to all employees globally. The Security Core Priority is not a check-the-box compliance exercise; it is a way for every employee and manager to commit to—and be accountable for—prioritizing security, and a way for us to codify your contributions and to recognize you for your impact. We all must act with a security-first mindset, speak up, and proactively look for opportunities to ensure security in everything we do.
