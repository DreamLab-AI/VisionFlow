  take a look at the sequence diagram in @/README.md 
  markdown files are pulled from github with the token, if the first line is public:: true, and if the SHA1 hash stored in the metadata which corresponds to that file is different to the SHA1 offered by github for the file (change) OR it is a new file plus public, in which case an entry with an SHA1 is created locally and the file is pulled. The perplexity augmentation for each file is currently turned off but should remain in place. The metadata for each file should list file size, number of hyperlinks in the file, the SHA1, the filename, and a link to the processed perplexity version (or a dummy field). The last time that perplexity was used on the file should also be stored as a simple date field. The actual contents of the markdown files should NOT be included in the metadata.json. Each file is stripped of it's square brackets completely during the process. When the whole file set is downloaded the software should use the filenames (without the md extension), mindful of spaces and non ascii chars as a list to search each markdown file for any occurances of any of the topics (filenames in the metadata). Each file entry should be populated with a json structure which shows how many times each of the topics is mentioned in that markdown file. If there are no mentions of a topic then it should not be mentions (ie Bitcoin: 0) but rather omitted as an entry. Any given pair of files may have a number of references in one direction and a number of references in the other direction, and these should be summed to create the attractor force for that edge.  currently it is possible that the code is using topics.csv, but this design supercedes, that. Take a long look around the rust codebase in src and try to figure out what is missing or incorrect, and initially just make a plan in writing which explains the variance and asks any questions.
