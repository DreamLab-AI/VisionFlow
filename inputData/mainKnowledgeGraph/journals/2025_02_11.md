	- 💥 ViTPose is a state-of-the-art pose estimation model with a simple design, which is now easily accessible through the Transformers library. It can detect keypoints, like the left arm or right shoulder, in an image. [](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAABdyx7ABQz23UUY38l5j8TTBv_RBAAVbtP8)[Pavel Iakubovskii](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pavel-iakubovskii/) created a very cool notebook showcasing how to optimize it for inference using tricks like `torch.compile`and the RoI-align algorithm. They allow him to go from 9 FPS (frames-per-second) to 47 FPS! Find his notebook below.
	- 💥 RT-DETRv2 was recently added to the Transformers library, a state-of-the-art Transformer-based model for real-time object detection (see the video below). Unlike the YOLOv8 and subsequent models from [Ultralytics](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ultralytics/), they come with an Apache 2.0 license, meaning you can freely use them for commercial purposes. [Roboflow](https://www.linkedin.com/company/roboflow-ai/) maintains a cool leaderboard on object detection models, and RT-DETRv2 is among the top, with very easy fine-tuning capabilities!
	- 💥 DAB-DETR was added to Transformers. This is an improvement over the original DETR model introduced by [Meta](https://www.linkedin.com/company/meta/) in 2020, which was the first successful attempt at using Transformers for object detection. This model speeds up the convergence issues the original DETR had. This model can be useful in case you are looking for great but not necessarily fast results.
	- 💥 the DepthPro model by [Apple](https://www.linkedin.com/company/apple/) was also just added in Transformers. This is a state-of-the-art model for metric depth estimation, which is the task of predicting depth based on a single image. The model is optimized for on-device use cases: it can tell you how far each pixel is in meters in less than a second. Quite impressive!
