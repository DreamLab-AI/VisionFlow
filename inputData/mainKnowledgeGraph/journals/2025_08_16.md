	- This is not just about keeping a dev server running, it is a way to let multiple agents operate continuously while you do other work, which is ideal for streaming data pipelines, live log analysis, and automation loops.
	- I found this hidden feature while looking through the source code of Claude code in the node modules folder.
	- Background Commands now have four activation paths: pressing Ctrl+B when Claude proposes a command, using the run_in_background flag in a Bash tool call, explicitly asking in a prompt, or managing tasks through the /bashes interface.
	- You can spawn many background processes at once, each running in its own shell with a unique ID, so you can check status, read logs, or terminate them at any time.
	- The /bashes command lets you introspect what is happening inside each process. This is especially useful for running interactive sessions where errors might appear in the console and the system can automatically fix them as they come in.
	- It is also ideal for long-running data streams such as trading applications, payment processors, shopping carts, or any workflow with constant incoming information. The system can run these in the background, check them every few seconds, and take action based on the results without interrupting the foreground process.
	- When paired with Claude’s new “Output Styles,” you can define how each agent reasons: Default for focused coding, Explanatory for annotated insights, Learning for collaborative work, or your own Custom Style for security, performance, or compliance.
	- With Claude Flow’s Swarm or Hive Mind, you can run multiple specialized agents in parallel, each with a different thinking style, continuously processing different streams and giving you a live, multi-angle operational view without breaking your workflow. The background process allows it to spawn long running sessions without interfering or blocking the main UI.
