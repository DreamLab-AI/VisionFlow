- The Text2Room algorithm generates 3D meshes from a given text prompt by synthesizing a sequence of images from different poses. The core idea is to select viewpoints such that the content of each image can be fused into a seamless, textured 3D mesh. The algorithm iteratively fuses scene frames with the existing geometry to create a seamless mesh. Unlike existing works that focus on generating single objects or zoom-out trajectories from text, our method generates complete 3D scenes with multiple objects and explicit 3D geometry.

- The VMesh system models a scene with a triangular mesh and a sparse volume for efficient view synthesis. It is trained on multi-view images of an object in three stages. First, a contiguous form of the representation is learned, where the surface part is modeled by a neural signed distance field, and the volume part is modeled by a neural density field. Then, the learned signed distance field is fixed and a triangular mesh is extracted from it as a substitution to be rendered jointly with the neural density field. Finally, the neural networks are dropped and the system is discretized to get the final assets for efficient storage and rendering. The triangular mesh is simplified and UV-parametrized, and the neural density field is first voxelized and pruned to a sparse volume, which is then organized by perfect spatial hashing to support fast indexing and compact storage. The system is able to render at 2K 60FPS on common consumer devices with high fidelity.

- Can AI-Generated Text be Reliably Detected?:
  (https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11156)
- In the paper "Can AI-Generated Text be Reliably Detected?", the authors show that current methods for detecting AI-generated text are not reliable in practical scenarios. They first demonstrate that paraphrasing attacks can break a range of detectors, including those using watermarking schemes and neural network-based detectors. They then provide a theoretical impossibility result showing that for a sufficiently good language model, even the best-possible detector can only perform marginally better than a random classifier. Finally, they show that even LLMs protected by watermarking schemes can be vulnerable to spoofing attacks where adversarial humans can add hidden watermarking signatures to their generated text.

- Language models like ChatGPT are not reliable for use as a search engine, but can be thought of as a "calculator for words". This means that they are good for manipulating language, but not for retrieving accurate information.

- The article discusses how the internet has ruined the [[Metaverse and Telecollaboration]], and how it can still be saved. It argues that the internet has made the [[Metaverse and Telecollaboration]] less accessible and has made it more difficult to find information. However, it also states that the [[Metaverse and Telecollaboration]] can still be saved if people are willing to work together to make it more accessible and user-friendly.
