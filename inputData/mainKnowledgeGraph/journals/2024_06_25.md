- [NuExtract](https://huggingface.co/spaces/numind/NuExtract) is model to transform any piece fo text into a structured output. You can use it to tackle any information extraction problem you have. To use the model, provide an input text (less than 2000 tokens) and a [[json]] template describing the information you need to extract. This model is purely extractive, so all information output by the model is present as is in the text. You can also provide a full output example to help the model understand your task more precisely.
