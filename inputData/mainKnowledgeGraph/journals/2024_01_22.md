- [[Education and AI]] [[Ethan Mollick]]
	- Three interesting findings from a trial use of a GPT-4 personalized tutor for Harvard's intro computer science course:
	  1) Students found it useful (88% found it helpful) & used it a lot (only 1% disliked the tutor)
	  2) The AI made mistakes, even with connections to a database using [[Knowledge Graphing]] (81% accurate answers overall)
	  3) It was cheap to run.
	  It is clear there is lots of potential for personalized AI tutors, but we also need more R&D to ensure they reach that potential
