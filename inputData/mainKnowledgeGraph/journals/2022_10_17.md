- Summary: The [CrossAttentionControl](https://github.com/bloc97/CrossAttentionControl) repository on GitHub presents an unofficial implementation of 'Prompt-to-Prompt Image Editing with Cross Attention Control' using Stable Diffusion. It offers enhanced control over image editing by modifying the attention maps of the diffusion model, eliminating the need for cumbersome input masks. Key features include image inversion, target replacement, style injection, global editing, and direct token attention control. The method is notable for its minimal performance penalties and no requirement for additional training or fine-tuning of the model.
