- Designing open federated [[Metaverse and Telecollaboration]] from a 25 year research foundation
  There are serious and under discussed natural social constraints on group behaviours, and these translate into social VR. For instance the ideal meeting size is 6, and this is naturally established in work settings. This has not translated into a [[Metaverse and Telecollaboration]] setting where dozens of people routinely crash across one another. In the context of supporting a creative backstage world where set planning, production shots, etc can be discussed we believe we have solutions which will get the best out of distributed teams of film-makers.
  Leveraging the world's most powerful decentralised computing network to create scale and security without high cost
  The Bitcoin network is more than just a speculative money like asset, it is the most secure distributed computing system ever built. We can jump on the back of this at almost no cost to enable scale for transfer of value, trust, and digital assets of provenance.
  Cryptographically assured end points
  With the cryptography tools provided through integration of the Bitcoin network we can also use non-blockchain based secure messaging, and identity proofs. Tying this back to Bitcoin itself can eliminate bots.
  Micro transactions in collaborative spaces
  New tooling the space allows fractions of a pound or dollar to be exchanged between parties across the world. This means that work can be paid Âby the secondÂ both inside and outside of the [[Metaverse and Telecollaboration]]. This radically improves creative microtask workflows.
  World leading open source machine learning and bot architectures
  By integrating Stablity AI tools for image generation, video processing, natural language, and speech to text / text to speech we hope to reduce friction within the backstage worlds. We plan to link the federated [[Metaverse and Telecollaboration]] ÂroomsÂ with economically empowered autonomous bots compatible with both web2 and web3.
  Connect a remote director/producer/DP, through a VP screen into a shoot, and back into a persistent [[Metaverse and Telecollaboration]] shared with the public
  By linking across these new systems with world class telepresence research we hope to use a single digital context to support senior stakeholders, creatives, technical teams, and the wider public.
  New paths to monetisation and digital ownership
  This unified digital back end is optimised for flows of money, trust, and digital objects. This is a new area for VP.
- Flossverse is a tool designed to enable telecollaboration between creative professionals globally. It aims to provide a seamless and productive environment for creative teams, enabling them to work together regardless of their location. The software is based on the integration of several components, including Bitcoin's powerful decentralized computing network, cryptography tools, and Stability AI tools.
  
  Flossverse's unique approach is focused on building an open federated [[Metaverse and Telecollaboration]], which leverages Bitcoin's powerful decentralized computing network to enable scale and security without high cost. The software provides a platform for microtransactions in collaborative spaces, which means work can be paid "by the second" both inside and outside of the [[Metaverse and Telecollaboration]].
  
  Flossverse also provides cryptography tools to offer non-blockchain-based secure messaging and identity proofs. The software is designed to eliminate bots by tying back to Bitcoin itself. Additionally, Flossverse integrates Stability AI tools for image generation, video processing, natural language, and speech to text/text to speech to reduce friction within the backstage worlds.
  
  Flossverse's platform is optimized for flows of money, trust, and digital objects. It offers a new area for VP, providing new paths to monetization and digital ownership. The software also provides a range of benefits for creative professionals, including seamless telecollaboration, reduced friction in the creative process, and the ability to work with distributed teams of film-makers.
  
  Overall, Flossverse presents a unique solution for creative professionals who require a seamless and productive telecollaboration tool. By leveraging Bitcoin's powerful decentralized computing network, cryptography tools, and Stability AI tools, Flossverse aims to revolutionize the open-source software industry and enable creative professionals to work together regardless of their location.
- Flossverse presents a compelling business case that has the potential to make a significant impact in the market. The company's approach is based on three primary inputs: market needs, open-source software, and Bitcoin's general atmosphere. By integrating these elements, Flossverse aims to produce a wide range of outputs, including knowledge, expertise, community engagement and reputation, products within Flossverse, and educational material.
  
  Flossverse's key components are modular, and they encompass a hand-wavy emergent integration of machine learning, human interfaces, identity management, and web2 messaging. Additionally, the company offers bitcoin-based digital assets, stablecoins, bitcoin micropayments, federated trust custody, and network and security features. While Flossverse has made progress in these areas, the company recognizes that there is still room for growth.
  
  To address these gaps, Flossverse is currently focusing on digital objects. By examining this area, the company hopes to shape the interactions with the database for the local instance of the world and develop a data exchange protocol between worlds, which is necessary for scaling. To achieve this, the team plans to create a slate of user stories and work backward from the product verticals.
  
  With substantial confidence in the overall design, the Flossverse team is ready to seek more specific funding to develop either a minimum viable product (MVP) or a full-blown solution. Additionally, the company is already in discussions with academia about a collaborative genomics bid and is part of a large Horizon bid for accessibility in the [[Metaverse and Telecollaboration]]. These initiatives underscore Flossverse's potential for success.
