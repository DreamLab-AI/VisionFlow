	- The list of occupations most exposed to large language modelling includes many of the same occupations exposed to AI more generally, with both lists including solicitors, psychologists and management consultants and business analysts. It also includes more [[Education and AI]] related occupations, particularly for post-16 training. This aligns with public statements around the potential use of generative AI tools by teachers, for example in preparing teaching material.
