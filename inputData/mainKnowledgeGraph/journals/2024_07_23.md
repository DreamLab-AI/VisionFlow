- [[]]The EFF discusses how [[Privacy, Trust and Safety]] Badger opts users out of Google's Privacy Sandbox, which is intended to replace third-party cookies with a new tracking system in Chrome. Despite its claims of enhanced privacy, Privacy Sandbox is critiqued for shifting tracking control from third-party to Google, thereby reinforcing Google's dominance in online advertising. The feature allows advertisers to continue targeting individuals based on their browsing behaviour, raising concerns about privacy despite Google's reassurances. Privacy Badger updates Chrome settings to disable three key Privacy Sandbox features: "Ad topics," which tracks users' interests; "Site-suggested ads," facilitating retargeting; and "Ad measurement," which lets advertisers build profiles based on interactions. The article encourages users to install Privacy Badger to protect their privacy online and points out that Privacy Sandbox has been found inadequate in achieving its purported privacy goals, thereby questioning the integrity of Google's privacy efforts.
