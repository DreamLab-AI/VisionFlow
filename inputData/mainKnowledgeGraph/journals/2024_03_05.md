			- Networking with Sounds From the Other City.
				- A huge thank you to those of you who came to the HOME Networking event last week. This will be the first of many conversations of HOME so please don't worry if you missed it. It was great to hear from so many of you how useful that opportunity was, and Sam and I want to continue to provide you with opportunities to network with prospective collaborators.
				- From the Other, best known for their Salford music festival [Sounds From the Other City](https://soundsfromtheothercity.com/), will be joining us for a networking event on 7th March from 3pm-5pm in the New Adelphi Studio. As well as the festival, From the Other are dedicated to enhancing Salford's contribution to artistic production, through initiatives such as artists in residence and student placements, and it would be great for us to discuss ways of working together.
