	- Researchers at MIT's CSAIL have created three "libraries of abstraction" to help AI learn new tasks in ways similar to human reasoning
		- LILO (library induction from language observations) uses the Stitch algorithm to identify abstractions, allowing LLMs to apply commonsense knowledge
		- Ada (action domain acquisition) recreates the background reasoning of the human mind for task planning
		- LGA (language-guided abstraction) helps robots complete complex tasks beyond simple image recognition
	- These techniques, while still limited in testing, show that complex reasoning may not always be exclusive to humans
