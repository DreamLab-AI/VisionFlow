- General models exist, and in English might even be topping out, though this is deemed very unlikely [[State Space and Other Approaches]] There is little unpolluted data left available at scale, but what we have can be cleaned up and there is enormous unexploited depth in very specialised data, and the ability to make much more at scale (think protein data)
- The opportunities now are likely in task specificity which can be benchmarked, tested with a vibe appropriate load balancer of general models on the front. This is familiar to product engineering.

	- It's inferencing between incredibly rich data domains between languages which don't exist that is the coming breakthrough. This is all enabled by having an LLM that is able to explain itself in natural language. Society will change if we get natural achieve breakthroughs, and be dependant.
