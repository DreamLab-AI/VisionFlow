	  Title: SurfSense: Never Forget anything you see/browse on the Internet.
	- SurfSense a knowledge graph Brain 🧠 for World Wide Web Surfers. Never forget anything you browse on the Internet.
	- In the backend SurfSense is all powered by Langchain & FastAPI. It tries to do GraphRAG for better results, if Graph can't be utilized then it fallbacks to Semantic Search.
	- This demo was on cheapest Open AI model i.e gpt-4o-mini
