	- She is human centred, with AI assistance, positing a human readable glossary which creates a framework for safeguarding and ethics and governance online.
	- I am machine centred in that I envision isolated emergent online communities who come to trust that the AI they have a contract with can understand other divergent contexts, and honour the personal framework for governance and safeguarding which they have negotiated before joining the ecosystem
	- These are not mutually exclusive but they have very different terminal points, and approaches. They are sufficiently different that they are best described as parallel theses on the future of human human interactions in cyberspace.
