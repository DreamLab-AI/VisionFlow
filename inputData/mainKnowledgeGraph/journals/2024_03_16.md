- This paper "presents a comprehensive empirical analysis of algorithmic progress in language model pre-training from 2012 to 2023. By curating a dataset of over 200 language model evaluations on WikiText and Penn Treebank benchmarks, they quantify the relative contributions of compute scaling and algorithmic efficiency improvements to the overall performance gains. They estimate that the compute required to reach a set language modelling performance level has halved every 8-9 months on average since 2012. This rate significantly exceeds hardware gains per Moore’s law and places language modelling among the fastest advancing domains in algorithmic progress, alongside computer vision and reinforcement learning.
