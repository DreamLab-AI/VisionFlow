				- ### **The Workflow works with other SDXL Turbo Models to but was made for Sleipnir**
				- **Step1:**
				- Select Extra Options/ Auto Queue
				- **Step2:** Write your prompt
				- **Step3:** Execute Queue Prompt make sure you have switches off (Stage2)
				- now you can play with all settings with just a slight latence ( depends on your Potato PC ;-))
				- after you have found your fav picture :
				- **Step4: **Disable Auto Queue and Stage 2 on ;-)
				- **Step5**: Execute Queue Prompt and your image is saved in a enhanced and upscaled version in the comfy ui output folder.
				- The max recommended resolution is **1024x1024!**
				- **Note: to get the full potential of Sleipnir FP32 in ComfyUI you need to add this Command-line Arguments: --force-fp32 important: FP32 needs more Vram and the generation is slower**
				- **the cfg range starts at 1-2/ 4 steps but i recommend 3cfg and 7 steps to start with 1024x1024 resolution.**
				- **I like also this sampler: **`DPM++ 2S a`
