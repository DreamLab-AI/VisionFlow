- https://www.afterbabel.com/p/parents-are-the-anxious-generation
	- [[]]This article by Lenore Skenazy explores how smartphones are contributing to a growing sense of anxiety among parents, coining them "The Anxious Generation." Key points include:
		- The relationship dynamic between parents and children changes significantly when phones are introduced, leading to increased apprehension and reliance on technology for reassurance.
		- A Harvard study indicates that anxiety levels are high not just among teens, but also among parents, suggesting that constant connectivity is fostering a cycle of anxiety rather than alleviating it.
		- Parents often express worry about their children’s safety, exacerbated by the ability to track their movements via technology, which undermines their ability to let go and trust their children’s independence.
		- Historically, parents had limited means to monitor their children's activities, which allowed for a natural development of trust. Current technology hampers this development by fostering constant supervision.
		- Skenazy highlights examples of how reliance on phones can prevent children from developing problem-solving skills and independence, as parents may rush to assist instead of allowing their children to learn and grow from challenges.
		- Recommendations for reducing parental anxiety include gradually allowing children to take on small tasks independently and using structured experiences, such as school assignments, to encourage self-sufficiency.

		- The analysis highlights significant trends, such as the inverse relationship between age and survival, and how socio-economic status influenced survival rates.
		- It also showcases how to enhance the agent's capabilities by introducing [[Machine Learning]] elements through libraries like sklearn for predictive modelling.
		- Finally, the agent's predictions for a competition are noted to have significantly outperformed initial manual attempts, underscoring the efficiency of using automated data analysis tools.
- https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-07-26/data-centre-electricity-grid-demand/104140808
	- Energy experts are concerned that the increasing demand from data centres could lead to higher electricity prices in Australia, potentially consuming 8% of the grid's demand by 2030.
		- Data centres currently account for approximately 5% of electricity usage, with predictions of this increasing significantly due to the rise of cloud computing and [[Artificial Intelligence]].
		- Prominent operators like NEXTDC emphasize the growing reliance on data in various sectors, indicating potential exponential growth in demand for data services.
		- Those in charge of energy supply, like Origin, are exploring renewable energy solutions and strategic site locations to meet the surging energy needs of data centres.
		- Experts warn that this demand could strain the electricity grid, particularly as more households transition to electrification, such as electric vehicles.
		- The Australian Energy Market Operator is projecting a nearly doubling of electricity consumption by 2050, presenting challenges in ensuring sustainable energy sources to meet this demand.
		- Solutions are being sought to balance this growth while keeping energy prices manageable and minimizing environmental impacts.

- https://www.aisnakeoil.com/p/ai-existential-risk-probabilities
	- [[]]The article argues that probability estimates regarding AI existential risks are too unreliable for policymakers to utilize effectively. It contends that while there may be some validity in academia, the forecasts made about the likelihood of human extinction due to AI are ultimately misguided and speculative. The authors outline three primary methods of probability estimation—inductive, deductive, and subjective—each highlighting severe deficiencies in applying them to AI x-risk forecasting:
		- Inductive probability estimation struggles because there is no comparable reference class for risks posed by AI, making historical data inadequate for making accurate predictions.
		- Deductive probability estimation is hampered by a lack of solid theoretical models that can accurately predict AI-related outcomes, particularly due to the unique nature of the threats involved.
		- Subjective estimates become mere guesses by experts, lacking a credible foundation or consistency, as indicated by wide-ranging probabilities among forecasters.
	- Furthermore, the article points out the social dynamics of the forecasting community, noting potential biases due to echo chambers that reinforce high-risk probabilities without robust evidence. Notably, it criticizes the tendency toward overestimating risks based on selection bias within both AI researchers and forecasting experts.
	- The authors conclude that instead of relying on questionable x-risk estimates, governments should adopt policies that are flexible enough to be beneficial across a range of potential AI outcomes, emphasising the need for transparency and rigorous justification in forecasting to enable informed decision-making.
