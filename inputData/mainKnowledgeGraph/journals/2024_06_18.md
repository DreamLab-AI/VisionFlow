- [RANDSTORM](https://www.unciphered.com/randstorm), a term coined to describe vulnerabilities in random number generation in web browsers from 2011-2015 [[Bitcoin]]
	- RANDSTORM is estimated to affect approximately 1.4M BTC, with a current value at risk between 1.2 - 2.1 Billion USD
	- The vulnerabilities do not fundamentally break Bitcoin or [[Blockchain]] technology, but rather stem from programming mistakes
	- Unciphered has disclosed the vulnerabilities to various vendors and recommends generating new wallets and moving assets to secure them
	- The vulnerabilities are not limited to Bitcoin, as similar flaws exist in popular DOGE wallet generation
	- The vulnerabilities are specific to JavaScript libraries for client-side key generation in browsers

- [MeshPose Project page](https://meshpose.github.io/): Unifying DensePose and 3D Body Mesh [[Human tracking and SLAM capture]] . This work introduces MeshPose to jointly tackle DensePose and HMR, achieving competitive DensePose accuracy and state-of-the-art 3D accuracy. Suitable for real-time AR applications. Outperforms HMR methods on DensePose metrics by more than 50%. Combines high FPS rate, small model size, and state-of-the-art reprojection accuracy. Models run on modern phones with accelerators. Exported ONNX versions of models show comparable timings to GPU-desktop timings. Presentation Video available. Strong temporal stability demonstrated in In-the-Wild Videos.
