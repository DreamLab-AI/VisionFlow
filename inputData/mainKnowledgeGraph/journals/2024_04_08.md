- Some [[Large language models]] information
	- Build a GPT from scratch, by Andrej Karpathy

	- If you want a conceptual understanding of language models from the ground up, @vcubingx just started a short series of videos on the topic:

	- If you're interested in the herculean task of interpreting what these large networks might actually be doing, the Transformer Circuits posts by Anthropic are great. In particular, it was only after reading one of these that I started thinking of the combination of the value and output matrices as being a combined low-rank map from the embedding space to itself, which, at least in my mind, made things much clearer than other sources.
