- The Rabbit R1 AI assistant device was found to log users' chat data on-device without the ability to erase it. A recent July 11th software update addressed these concerns by adding a Factory Reset option. Previously, user account unlinking did not delete all stored data. The update also fixed an issue where pairing data could read the Rabbithole journal, posing a security risk if the device was stolen or hacked. Rabbit has stated that there has been no evidence of misuse of the pairing data but noted hardcoded API keys in its codebase due to an employee's leak, leading to that employee’s termination. The company is committed to reviewing and enhancing its security practices.

- This GitHub repository contains Python scripts for 3D scene segmentation using Blender's API. The project aims to enhance image understanding for machine learning and visualisation by meticulously classifying each pixel in a 3D model. Features include:
	- Semantic and sub-segmentation of 3D objects.
	- Generation of JSON files mapping colours to descriptors.
	- Consistent colour mapping for debugging and analysis.
	- Quick processing and high colour depth support (8-bit to 32-bit).
	- Future plans include instance segmentation, automatic object detection, and Cryptomatte automation. Installation guides and detailed script overviews are provided to help developers integrate the system with Blender and other tools, aiding in precise 3D model segmentation.

- Google’s Gemini AI was found scanning private documents on Google Drive without users' explicit permission. Privacy advocate Kevin Bankston reported that Gemini summarised his tax return without him enabling this feature. Google claims users must proactively enable Gemini in Google Workspace, and it does not store content without permission. However, Bankston discovered Gemini’s controls were difficult to locate and not well-advertised. Additionally, even with settings disabled, Gemini continued to summarize documents. Google responded by pointing to its privacy-preserving measures and suggesting the issue might be due to integration with Google Workspace Labs. This incident raises significant privacy concerns regarding AI-enabled document processing.
