	  in this project the README offers insights to the functionality. We are using test driven design, and currently working on the javascript elements within the public/js/ subdirectories, which contains 15 scripts. Our focus should start with the unit test suite in tests/client/ where there are 15 matching tests. They pass unit testing at this stage, but they are simply placeholders. We should choose the best entry point and build out one of the tests and it's corresponding code. In the root directory is a file called previousImplementationJavascript.txt which contains two scripts which were functional client code in the previous version. They contain insights and ideas, but might not be optimal, and certainly do not map to our new file structure. Choose a best in class component to start building out functionality in line with TDD, modifying the test js with the relevant functionality and we will move forward from there.
