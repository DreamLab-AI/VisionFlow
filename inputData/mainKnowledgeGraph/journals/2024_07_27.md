	- The FAST-RIR project on GitHub provides an official implementation of a neural-network-based Fast Diffuse Room Impulse Response Generator, designed to create room impulse responses (RIRs) for various acoustic environments, particularly in indoor rectangular settings.
		- Key features include:
			- Utilisation of a model inspired by StackGAN architecture.
			- Ability to generate RIRs for 3D indoor scenes using meshes.
			- Release of additional tools like the Speech2IR estimator.
			- It operates within specified ranges for room dimensions and reverberation times.
		- Requirements for running the software include Python 3.6 and several libraries such as PyTorch and librosa.
		- Instructions for generating RIRs involve downloading the trained model, creating normalized embeddings, and running specific commands to produce RIR outputs.
		- The project encourages citations for academic use and provides relevant related works in the field of room impulse response generation.
		- Topics associated with the project encompass [[Deep Learning]], neural networks, generative adversarial networks, and synthetic data generation, among others.
		- [[license]]: The project is available under the AGPL-3.0 licence.

	- In this second part of his series on prompt optimization, Austin Starks discusses creating an automated prompt optimizer to improve his AI-powered stock screener, addressing frustrations with traditional **[[Prompt Engineering]]**.
		- The optimizer leverages **evolutionary algorithms**, mimicking natural selection by generating and refining prompt variations over multiple generations.
		- Initial methods laid out in Part 1 were adjusted due to practical challenges, such as manually creating initial prompts, generating multiple offspring per generation, and adopting a simplified mutation process.
		- Results show significant improvements in both training and validation accuracy, with a rise from 71% to over 85% in training fitness and peaks above 84% in validation fitness, indicating effective generalization to unseen data.
		- Challenges faced included ensuring the **accuracy of ground truth data**, difficulties in generating high-quality prompts through models, and the high cost of computational resources, particularly when using models like GPT-4o mini.
		- Future enhancements for prompt optimization could involve model selection optimization, expanding datasets, and multi-objective optimization to tackle various performance criteria.
		- Starks emphasizes the potential for breakthrough developments in AI interaction stemming from these prompt optimizations, expressing excitement for future experimentation and applications in the field of **[[Artificial Intelligence]]** and **[[Technology Adoption]]**.
