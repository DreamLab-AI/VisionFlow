	- CNBC and SurveyMonkey, a global leader in online surveys and forms, today revealed the results of their December 2023 Workforce Survey, which found that nearly 3 in 10 workers have used artificial intelligence (AI) tools at work but 4 in 10 are concerned about AI’s impact on their careers. The survey also found that half of workers would like their company to offer fully-paid healthcare premiums (51%), 401(k) matching (37%), reimbursement for health facilities/gym (27%), or free food onsite (26%). In addition, only 3 in 10 workers say their workplace offers financial coaching or advising, while 1 in 4 GenZer’s and 1 in 5 Millennials decide to invest because they are driven by the possibility of short-term gains.
	- The SurveyMonkey online poll was conducted Dec. 4-8 among a national sample of 7,776 workers in the country. Respondents for the survey were selected from the more than two million people who take surveys on the SurveyMonkey platform every day.
	- Compared to the [May 2023 CNBC|SurveyMonkey Workforce Survey](http://email.nbcuni.com/c/eJxUjj1uxSAQhE-DOyx2F7ApKNJY6XMCwIsgzz9PmMjXj5wuzUijGX36Vk-WUA3sYVLoHDgDQ_Ez2hytAgQwxkWVk1MhE2hCjAbmoXpUSIDggMABjFGFYHQE6xiSWbXQ6ojp56hjOvdh86X39yXoQ-AicLnve0xHTM8ocHlYAhdln5gFLr3wxTI0lr2wvM_24nbJ_bz6U1rlVfYSugxV3nXb5HWeh-zh9fevTX6f8RpL37eh-a_O7zJ-1rbxHo7jv1j3JgDgSoCZZjVBjMkZMqxZOQRKaegeVMzWEueodSbtjJ31NBNDyOwy0m8AAAD__0gMYNA), this month’s survey found that:
		- 85% of workers are satisfied with their job (no change)
		- 72% say they are well paid (-1 point)
		- 90% say their work is meaningful to them (-1 point)
		- 36% say they’ve seriously considered quitting their job in the last three months (-1 point)
		- 71% rate morale at their company as excellent or good (-1 point)
	- “It is clear from our research that while AI in the workplace is not yet widespread, there are concerns from workers about its potential impact on careers,” said Lara Belonogoff, senior director of brand management at SurveyMonkey. “As employers think holistically about workplace happiness, fostering an environment where technological advancements are considered alongside employee well-being and professional growth is imperative.”
	- **Artificial Intelligence [[Surveys]]**
		- Nearly 3 in 10 (29%) say they have used artificial intelligence (AI) tools at work, with Gen Zers (37%) and Millennials (35%) more likely to have used the technology compared with Gen Xers (25%) and Boomers (17%).
