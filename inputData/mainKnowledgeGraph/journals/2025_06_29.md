- **Octelium is a free and open source, self-hosted, unified platform for zero trust resource access that is primarily meant to be a modern alternative to corporate VPNs and remote access tools, yet it is built to be generic enough to not only operate as a ZTNA/BeyondCorp platform, but also an API gateway, an AI gateway, an infrastructure for MCP gateways and A2A architectures, a PaaS-like platform for secure as well as anonymous hosting and deployment, a Kubernetes gateway/ingress/load balancer and even as an infrastructure for your own homelab. Octelium provides a scalable zero trust architecture (ZTA) for identity-based, application-layer (L7) aware secret-less secure access, via both private client-based access over WireGuard/QUIC tunnels as well as public clientless access (i.e. BeyondCorp), for users, both humans and workloads, to any private/internal resource behind NAT in any environment as well as to publicly protected resources such as SaaS APIs and databases via context-aware access control on a per-request basis through policy-as-code.**  [Introduction - Octelium Docs](https://octelium.com/docs/octelium/latest/overview/intro) [[infrastructure]]
