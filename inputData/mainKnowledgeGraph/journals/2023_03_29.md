- How to Use ModelScope text2video with Automatic1111Âs Stable Diffusion Web UI | kombitz: Enable the Extension Click on the Extension tab and then click on Install from URL. Enter https://github.com/deforum-art/sd-webui-modelscope-text2video in the URL box and click on Install. Click on Installed and click on Apply and restart UI. Go to your stable-diffusion-webui/models folder and create a folder called ModelScope and then create a folder called t2v under ModelScope. This is your models folder for text2video.

- The Picsart-AI-Research/Text2Video-Zero repository contains code for a text-to-image diffusion model that can be used to generate videos from text input. The model is a zero-shot video generator, meaning that it does not require any training data in order to generate videos.
- The Make-It-3D algorithm can create high-fidelity 3D content from only a single image. It uses a two-stage optimization pipeline, first optimizing a neural radiance field by incorporating constraints from the reference image and diffusion prior, and then transforming the coarse model into textured point clouds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the algorithm outperforms prior works, resulting in faithful reconstructions and impressive visual quality.

- Vox-E: The paper presents a method for text-guided voxel editing of 3D objects, which is demonstrated on a variety of real-world scenes. The edited results are compared to the initial grid, showing the effectiveness of the method. Additionally, a refinement stage is shown to further improve the results for local edits.

- The 3DFuse framework enables robust [[3D and 4D]] generation by incorporating 3D awareness into pretrained 2D diffusion models. This is achieved by first constructing a coarse 3D structure of a given text prompt, and then utilizing projected, view-specific depth maps as a condition for the diffusion model. Additionally, a training strategy is introduced that enables the 2D diffusion model to learn to handle the errors and sparsity within the coarse 3D structure for robust generation, as well as a method for ensuring semantic consistency throughout all viewpoints of the scene.
