	- Contract agents on the edge (assist human actors in setting up their preferences, tolerances, limit choices)
	- Scene agents (governance, FIFO, cryptography, warnings, reputation management, real time language translation, enforcement).
		- Constantly outputting up-to-date scene ontology reflecting the settings negotiated with the user base of the space (feeds transfer agents)
