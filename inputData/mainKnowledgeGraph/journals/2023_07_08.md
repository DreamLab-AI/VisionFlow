- [[Stable Diffusion]] workflow [very early but simply post](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/14sacvt/how_to_use_sdxl_locally_with_comfyui_how_to/)
- UI tips
- when you have a node selected, hold down shift click to move it around according to the background grid
- when you have a node being resized, if you hold down shift while you click and move it, it will resize it in uniform sizes (just like the grid)
- shift + selecting multiple nodes is great but can be time consuming to select a lot of nodes.
- use control + left mouse button drag to marquee select many nodes at once, (and then use shift + left click drag to move them around)
- in the clip text encoding, put the cursor on a word you want to add or remove weights from, and use CTRL+ Up or Down arrow and it will auto-weight it in increments of 0.05
- reroute nodes can also have their color changed (so its easier to track positive and negative prompts)
- right clicking on reroute nodes and selecting "Show Type" will show you the type of data flowing through that re-route
- right clicking on reroute nodes and selecting something like "Change to Vertical" will switch the reroute node to be a vertical (up and down) facing node
- higher CFG will mean that you will get sharper image and less "creative results" ie it will stick to your prompt more. good for fidelity.
- don't be afraid to play around with the samplers and schedulers, just make sure you're also playing with the amount of steps to run through on a per-sampler basis. euler often takes about 30-40 while dpmpp anything can take up to 50 steps.
- assuming you get the original .png file, the EXIF data will contain the ENTIRE WORKFLOW to generate the pic you're looking at. discord wipes this data, but matrix chat client does not.
