- Nostr did
	- Dear W3C Nostr Community Group,
	  
	  Exciting news! The DID-Nostr specification and resolver are now production-ready with full W3C Multikey support and offline-first capabilities.
	  
	  What's New
	  
	  We've clarified the DID-Nostr spec [1] to support deterministic, offline-first resolution. Your Nostr pubkey 32e1827... becomes a globally resolvable did:nostr:32e1827... that works across the entire web - no network required!
	  
	  Why This Matters for Nostr Devs
	  
	  Think of DIDs as your Nostr identity's passport to the broader web. Any web service can now understand and verify your Nostr identity using standard W3C protocols. Your existing secp256k1 keys just work.
	  
	  Minimal DID Document (Generated Instantly)
	  
	    {
	      "@context": ["[https://w3id.org/did](https://w3id.org/did)", "[https://w3id.org/nostr/context](https://w3id.org/nostr/context)"],
	      "id": "did:nostr:124c0fa99407182ece5a24fad9b7f6674902fc422843d3128d38a0afbee0fdd2",
	      "verificationMethod": [{
	        "type": "Multikey",
	        "publicKeyMultibase": "fe70102124c0fa99407182ece5a24fad9b7f6674902fc422843d3128d38a0afbee0fdd2"
	      }],
	      "authentication": ["#key1"]
	    }
	  
	  This is fully W3C DID Core compliant [2] and provides complete cryptographic functionality for authentication and signatures.
	  
	  Game-Changing Benefits
	- Zero Dependencies: Works offline, no relay connectivity needed
	- Instant Resolution: Pure computation, zero latencyStandards Compliant: Full W3C DID Core and Multikey support
	- Extensible: Add service endpoints, credentials, cross-protocol bridges, wallets, storage
	- Production Ready: Handles edge cases, network failures gracefully
	  
	  Get Started Now
	  
	  sudo npm install -g did-nostr-resolver
	  
	  did-nostr-resolver resolve did:nostr:32e1827635450ebb3c5a7d12c1f8e7b2b514439ac10a67eef3d9fd9c5c68e245
	  
	  Instant, reliable DID resolution from any Nostr pubkey. Enhanced mode with relay queries available via --enhanced flag.
	  
	  This bridges Nostr's simple, decentralized identity model with W3C standards while keeping everything that makes Nostr great: offline-first, no dependencies, pure cryptography.
	  
	  The future of interoperable identity is here. Nostr identities can now participate in the broader web ecosystem seamlessly.
	  
	  Ready for production use today!
	  
	  Best,
	  Melvin Carvalho
