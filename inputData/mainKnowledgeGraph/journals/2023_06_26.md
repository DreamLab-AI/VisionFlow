- Swap Service is an orderbook that allows for submarine swaps over Nostr, enabling Bitcoin users to earn a yield on their Bitcoin. Submarine swaps allow for the swapping of funds on Lightning for funds on the base layer and vice versa, without the need for opening or closing channels or giving custody of funds to other people. Swap Service also enables channel rebalancing and is the foundation for wallets and services like Muun, Lightning Loop, and Boltz Exchange. Anyone who runs an LND Lightning node can become a yield chaser by running Swap Service on their computer and hooking it up to their node. Yield chasers can set parameters and earn a fee for swaps. Swap Service is available on both the mainnet and testnet. https://www.nobsbitcoin.com/swap-service-submarine-swaps-over-nostr/

- On May 16, Lightning Labs announced Taproot Assets v0.2, the newest version of its scalable protocol to issue assets on Bitcoin and Lightning. Taproot Assets v0.2 has a core set of features that enable developers to issue assets and bitcoinize assets in a chain-efficient manner. This specific version offers a variety of useful features, such us vPSBT support for send and receive, Universe APIs for asset discovery and multi-asset transactions to save chain space. The team called all bitcoin and Lightning developers to test the code, give feedback and start building on Taproot Assets. Â The announcement has generated feedback from users on Twitter, including comments calling for Bolt12, RGB, and Podcast Token. https://twitter.com/lightning/status/1658497809895809025

- The Swap Service is an order book designed for performing submarine swaps over the [[Nostr]] protocol. It provides users with a way to earn yield on their bitcoin holdings. Submarine swaps allow lightning users to swap funds on the lightning network for funds on the base layer, or vice versa, without opening and closing channels and without the need to give custody of their money to other people. They are also beneficial for channel rebalancing and create the foundation for important wallets and services such as Muun, Lightning Loop and Boltz Exchange. Any person running an LND lightning node can run the Swap Service on their computer to become a yield chaser, setting parameters, such as how much sats they are willing to swap and the fee for swaps, with the Swap Service providing a simple tool to execute these actions. The Swap Service website includes a demo video and instruction for use on the mainnet or testnet. https://www.nobsbitcoin.com/swap-service-submarine-swaps-over-nostr/(https://www.nobsbitcoin.com/swap-service-submarine-swaps-over-nostr/)
- Diamond Hands has released an alpha version of Shiro Wallet, which is compatible with [[RGB and Client Side Validation]] protocol and can be added easily to other services by calling endpoints for the wallet. It is an open-source, self-hosted RGB wallet for the Bitcoin blockchain. Shiro Wallet can issue, send and receive fungible RGB tokens, which allows users to experiment with the protocol and gain first-hand experience. The wallet is a web-server wallet and can be integrated easily with other services. It is the first RGB wallet available on Umbrel, a popular Bitcoin node management platform. However, the current form of Shiro Wallet is still very rough and alpha and only available on testnet for now. https://www.nobsbitcoin.com/shiro-wallet-umbrel-release/

- The nbd-wtf/soma repository on GitHub is a demo Spacechain that allows users to issue and transfer non-fungible assets on a fully-fledged blockchain that does not require any shitcoins to be created or spam to be dumped into the Bitcoin chain. The blockchain is designed using SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT and runs on signet. The repository includes a Docker container with everything pre-packaged for running the Spacechain demo, along with a tutorial. There are also hosted tools available for users who just want to see something happen. The repository is primarily written in Scala and JavaScript, with smaller portions written in Dockerfile, HTML, Go, Shell, and Makefile. https://github.com/nbd-wtf/soma

- BRC-20 is an experiment to test if ordinal theory can facilitate fungibility on Bitcoin. It allows for the deployment, minting, and transfer of token amounts through a JSON file inscription, enabling the tracking of rudimentary token balances on Bitcoin. BRC-20 defines ticker length as four characters, with little to no restrictions on character type. The deployment contract sets a maximum "limit" amount for the token, which anyone can mint after. The activity around BRC-20s remained modest until early March, but exploded in late April, leading to Bitcoin network transactions surpassing regular Bitcoin transactions for two days straight. However, this creates a significant risk to the ecosystem as third-party services keep track of balances and token indexes instead of the Bitcoin blockchain or ord client, potentially exposing third party security to systemic risk. The ecosystem is accelerating with DeFi-type "liquidity pool" standards popping up as it mirrors the early stages of the previous crypto cycle before DeFi Summer. This is an ongoing and rapidly developing story, which requires continued tracking of the Ordinals ecosystem. https://blog.ordinalhub.com/brc-20-mania/

- A new open-source Bitcoin blockchain analyzer is being developed to provide regular Bitcoin users with tools to research their transactions and avoid high fees charged by analytics companies. A recent post found that over 80% of inscriptions created in early-mid May 2023 belonged to a single entity, controlled by a single private key, belonging to a possible user of Unisat. The centralisation of control means a single entity can significantly impact the entire Blockchain regime, with the tests highlighting worrying vulnerabilities in the Bitcoin network. Further research is required to address the issue. https://block21m.substack.com/p/most-bitcoin-inscriptions-belong-d6d

- Ark is a privacy-focused off-chain protocol that offers anonymity similar to the classic Chaumian eCash system. However, unlike eCash, transactions made through Ark are backed by actual bitcoins, making it more secure. Compared to Lightning, Ark is a liquidity network that consumes significantly less on-chain footprint and allows recipients to receive payments without acquiring inbound liquidity or revealing their identity. Ark also mimics the on-chain wallet UX but does not require transactions to be on-chain and does not introduce inbound liquidity constraints. Compared to validity rollups, Ark has higher throughput as it does not require on-chain data per transaction. While in theory, Ark service providers can double-spend their pool transactions while they sit on mempool, users can redeem their previously redeemed coins through a hypothetical data manipulation opcode in case of double-spending. Overall, Ark offers a more secure and private way to make transactions that is faster and more efficient than other methods available. https://www.arkpill.me/faq

- The text provides a tutorial on how to mint an asset and send it to someone else using Soma, a decentralized cryptocurrency platform. The tutorial starts by directing the user to create a keypair for themselves and generate a MINT transaction by clicking "mint". The next step involves sending the MINT transaction to a miner using a web interface and then paying the invoice using a webpage provided by the platform, which pays invoices for the user since they probably don't have a signet Lightning node. The user is then advised to keep the tab open while the miner successfully publishes the block, after which the payment is resolved, or fails. The user can also check the status of the next block the miner is trying to publish by calling "get status". Once the block is mined, it is broadcasted to all Soma nodes and reflected on the explorer. The user can then go back to the platform and transfer the asset by clicking "send" and providing the asset ID, destination public key, and a counter. https://github.com/nbd-wtf/soma/blob/master/tutorial-web.md

- Ark is a payment system that provides anonymity to users and operates similarly to the classic Chaumian eCash system. However, unlike eCash, every transaction made through Ark is backed by actual bitcoins, preventing the possibility of the Ark Service Provider (ASP) stealing or inflating them. Compared to Lightning, another payment network, Ark does not introduce liquidity constraints or a direct link between the sender and receiver, enabling recipients to receive payments without acquiring inbound liquidity or revealing their [[Distributed Identity]]. In terms of UX, Ark mimics on-chain wallets by allowing async receiving and not introducing inbound liquidity constraints, but requires users to come online and "refresh" their coins every few weeks, or else the ASP can sweep the funds. Compared to validity rollups, Ark's higher throughput is due to not requiring on-chain data per transaction. If an ASP were to double-spend their pool transactions on mempool, incoming zero-conf vtxos can be used to pay lightning invoices, rendering double-spending a footgun for the service operator. A future extension of Ark can utilize a hypothetical data manipulation opcode to prevent double-spending. https://www.arkpill.me/faq

- Ryan Hoover, founder of Product Hunt, tweeted an idea for an ÂAI SpotifyÂ that could host AI-generated music by submitting music with the best tracks based on listens and likes earning a pro-rata share of subscription revenue, reserved for original artists. The tweet sparked interest, leading to someone building the platform called Beatly Music, while some artists expressed interest in the idea. However, industry insiders, including Scott Belsky, have questioned why Spotify might not just do this themselves since they already have the fan graph, the data set, and relationship with artists. But it may be too risky to navigate for a large company with record labels as a key stakeholder. While the idea has potential, there are many ethical and legal issues with this model, especially with labels. Nevertheless, Beatly Music carries a considerable risk as several legal concerns may arise regarding music rights and royalties, stating that some significant damages, including [[copyright]] infringement charges or compounding royalties to record labels and artists, might come up. https://twitter.com/rrhoover/status/1647735300511154176
