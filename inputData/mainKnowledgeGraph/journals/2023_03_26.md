- GPTs are GPTs: An Early Look at the Labor Market Impact
(https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10130)
- The text discusses the potential implications of Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models on the U.S. labor market. It uses a new rubric to assess occupations based on their correspondence with GPT capabilities, incorporating both human expertise and classifications from GPT-4. The findings indicate that approximately 80% of the U.S. workforce could have at least 10% of their work tasks affected by the introduction of GPTs, while around 19% of workers may see at least 50% of their tasks impacted. The influence spans all wage levels, with higher-income jobs potentially facing greater exposure. Notably, the impact is not limited to industries with higher recent productivity growth. The text concludes that Generative Pre-trained Transformers exhibit characteristics of general-purpose technologies (GPTs), suggesting that these models could have notable economic, social, and policy implications.
