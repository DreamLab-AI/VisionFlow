- [Software Is Reorganizing the World | WIRED](https://www.wired.com/2013/11/software-is-reorganizing-the-world-and-cloud-formations-could-lead-to-physical-nations/) [[Convergence]] [[MUST]]
	- The article "Software Is Reorganizing the World" by Balaji Srinivasan discusses how cloud computing and the internet are revolutionizing social and physical structures. As economic challenges make younger generations poorer than their parents, people are turning to the cloud for opportunities, forming virtual communities that increasingly influence physical migrations and settlements.
	- While traditional physical frontiers are closed, the digital world offers endless opportunities. Online communities allow individuals to connect with like-minded peers across vast distances, easing feelings of isolation common in modern urban or rural settings. Over time, these cloud-based subcultures are beginning to manifest physically, as technology enhances mobility and connectivity.
	- Examples of digital-to-physical community formations include small gatherings like hacker houses, startup incubators, and large-scale assemblies such as Occupy Wall Street or the Arab Spring protests. These communities are further facilitated by advancements in technology like machine translation, telepresence robots, and autonomous vehicles, which diminish the importance of physical location.
	- The concept is extending to creating co-living and co-housing initiatives globally, enabled by the ease of finding compatible peers online. Technology is also driving the restructuring of transportation, infrastructure, and everyday goods, making physical migration more feasible. This emerging "reverse diaspora" sees international cloud communities forming and possibly leading to new towns, cities, and even countries.
	- The future could see these virtual communities coalescing into physical entities, reshaping geography. Notably, Silicon Valley, the current hub of tech innovation, underscores this trend, but similar formations are appearing globally. The long-term goal of creating new nations or regions influenced by cloud communities remains speculative but increasingly plausible. Ultimately, as technology continues to bridge digital and physical realms, it is poised to reorganize societal structures fundamentally.
