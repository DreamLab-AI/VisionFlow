## Treasury Management

Treasury Management refers to a component of the blockchain ecosystem.

- Industry adoption of blockchain-enabled treasury management is accelerating, with many companies integrating cryptoassets into their liquidity strategies.
  - Notable platforms include Fireblocks, Kyriba, and traditional financial institutions like J.P. Morgan, which are leveraging blockchain for real-time payments, automation, and enhanced forecasting.
  - Cryptoasset treasury strategies are diversifying, with companies adopting multi-currency holdings to mitigate volatility and capture broader digital asset growth.
- Technical capabilities now enable near-instant settlement of cross-border payments via stablecoins, reducing reliance on correspondent banks and traditional wire transfers.
  - Blockchain networks operate continuously, providing transparency, cryptographic security, and decentralised consensus mechanisms that enhance reliability.
- Limitations include regulatory complexity, especially in multinational contexts, and the need for robust anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) compliance.
- Standards and frameworks are emerging to govern stablecoin issuance, tokenised money market funds, and digital asset custody, with regulatory bodies increasingly involved in defining compliance requirements.
