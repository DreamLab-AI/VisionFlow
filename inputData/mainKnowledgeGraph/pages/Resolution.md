## Academic Context

- The term "rb 0036 resolution" primarily relates to regulatory and reporting frameworks concerning financial institutions' resolution planning and data reporting standards.
  - Key developments include the evolution of resolution planning guidance for banks, particularly large and complex institutions, to ensure rapid and orderly resolution in financial distress.
  - Academic foundations stem from regulatory risk management, financial stability studies, and data taxonomy standardisation in banking supervision.

## Current Landscape (2025)

- Industry adoption of rb 0036 resolution frameworks is evident in banking regulation and supervisory reporting, particularly within the European Banking Authority (EBA) and the Single Resolution Board (SRB).
  - Notable organisations implementing these standards include the SRB, which extends the EBA 3.2 Reporting Framework with its own taxonomy for resolution reporting, and US regulators like the FDIC and Federal Reserve, which have issued updated guidance for resolution planning at large banks.
  - In the UK, financial institutions under the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Bank of England align with these frameworks, with particular attention to resolution planning for systemically important banks.
  - North England financial centres such as Manchester and Leeds, while not primary banking hubs like London, contribute through fintech innovation and regulatory technology firms supporting compliance and reporting.
- Technical capabilities include the use of XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language) taxonomies for structured data reporting, with SRB providing extensions to improve data quality and validation rules.
- Limitations remain in the complexity of implementing multi-jurisdictional resolution plans and ensuring consistent data quality across institutions.
- Standards and frameworks include the EBA 3.2 taxonomy, SRB extensions, and US FDIC guidance on resolution plans, reflecting a global trend towards harmonised resolution planning.

  - European Banking Authority (2025). *EBA Methodological Guide on Risk Indicators and Reporting*. EBA Publications. Available at: [EBA website]
  - Single Resolution Board (2025). *SRB Taxonomy Extension for Resolution Reporting*. SRB Reports.
- Ongoing research focuses on improving resolution plan effectiveness, cross-border coordination, and enhancing data taxonomy for better supervisory analytics.

## UK Context

- British contributions include the Bank of England’s active role in resolution planning frameworks and collaboration with the PRA to ensure UK banks meet international standards.
- North England innovation hubs such as Manchester and Newcastle are increasingly involved in regulatory technology (RegTech) solutions that facilitate compliance with resolution reporting requirements.
- Regional case studies highlight fintech firms in Leeds developing XBRL reporting tools that assist mid-sized banks in meeting SRB and EBA taxonomy requirements, demonstrating a practical application of rb 0036 resolution standards outside London.

## Future Directions

- Emerging trends include greater automation in resolution data reporting, enhanced use of artificial intelligence for risk assessment, and increased focus on climate-related financial risks within resolution planning.
- Anticipated challenges involve harmonising resolution frameworks post-Brexit, managing data privacy concerns, and addressing the complexity of global banking groups’ resolution strategies.
- Research priorities emphasise cross-jurisdictional cooperation, improving data validation techniques, and integrating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into resolution planning.
