# Transformer Architecture – Updated Ontology Entry

## Academic Context

- Neural network architecture fundamentally based on multi-head attention mechanisms
  - Eliminates recurrent and convolutional components entirely, enabling parallel processing
  - Originally developed for sequence-to-sequence tasks, particularly machine translation
  - Proposed in seminal 2017 paper "Attention Is All You Need" by Google researchers[5]
  - Represents paradigm shift from RNN/LSTM approaches by removing sequential bottlenecks

- Core innovation: self-attention mechanism
  - Allows each token to attend to every other token in the input sequence simultaneously
  - Computes relevance weights between sequence components, capturing contextual relationships
  - Enables the model to identify which words matter most for understanding meaning[2]
  - Linear transformation at each layer, followed by non-linear feed-forward sublayers[4]

## Current Landscape (2025)

- Encoder-decoder architecture remains foundational
  - Encoder transforms input sequence into contextual representation (context vector)
  - Decoder generates output sequence iteratively, consuming encoder output and previously generated tokens[4]
  - Original design: 6 encoder and 6 decoder layers (now variable based on task requirements)[1]
  - Each layer comprises multi-head self-attention sublayer plus position-wise feed-forward network[2]

- Adapted architectures dominate modern applications
  - Decoder-only models: GPT family predicts next token in sequence[5]
  - Encoder-only models: BERT performs masked token prediction for bidirectional context[5]
  - Reflects practical finding that full encoder-decoder architecture unnecessary for many tasks
  - Significantly reduces computational requirements compared to original design

- Technical components and processing pipeline
  - Embedding layer converts tokens into fixed-size vectors capturing semantic nuance[2]
  - Positional embeddings compensate for transformers' lack of inherent sequential awareness[2]
  - Linear and softmax blocks convert internal representations into probability distributions over vocabulary[3]
  - Residual connections and layer normalisation stabilise training across deep architectures[2]

- Industry adoption and implementations
  - Large language models (LLMs) trained on massive datasets now standard across technology sector
  - Applications span machine translation, speech recognition, protein sequence analysis, computer vision (vision transformers), reinforcement learning, multimodal learning, and robotics[5]
  - Pre-trained transformer systems enable transfer learning across diverse downstream tasks
  - Computational efficiency advantages over RNNs enable training on unprecedented dataset scales[5]

- UK and North England context
  - DeepMind (London-based, Alphabet subsidiary) continues foundational AI research utilising transformer architectures
  - University of Manchester hosts significant machine learning research groups exploring transformer applications in healthcare and scientific computing
  - Leeds and Sheffield universities contribute to NLP research and industrial applications
  - UK AI sector increasingly adopts transformers for financial services, healthcare diagnostics, and language processing applications
