  - **Definition**
    - definition:: The SecurityLayer represents the abstraction level of security-focused implementations, cryptographic mechanisms, threat models, security protocols, and defensive systems that protect blockchain and distributed systems from attacks, ensure data integrity and authenticity, provide confidentiality and privacy, and maintain system security properties. This layer encompasses cryptographic primitives as implemented security mechanisms (hash functions providing integrity, digital signatures providing authentication, encryption providing confidentiality), security protocols (key exchange, secure communication, authentication protocols), threat models and attack vectors (51% attacks, Sybil attacks, eclipse attacks, smart contract vulnerabilities), security analysis and verification (formal verification, security auditing, penetration testing), defensive mechanisms (access control, authorization, sandboxing, rate limiting), and security properties as realised through specific implementations (immutability through hash linking, non-repudiation through digital signatures, privacy through zero-knowledge proofs). Unlike ConceptualLayer which addresses abstract security properties, SecurityLayer focuses on concrete security implementations and mechanisms. Unlike generic ProtocolLayer, SecurityLayer emphasises security-specific considerations: threat resistance, attack prevention, security guarantees, cryptographic soundness, and defensive architectures.
    - purpose:: To provide classification for security-focused implementations and mechanisms, enabling systematic understanding of how blockchain and distributed systems achieve security properties through concrete cryptographic, protocol, and architectural implementations, and how systems defend against specific threat models
    - coverage:: This layer covers approximately 50 security-focused concepts including cryptographic implementations (hash functions, digital signatures, encryption schemes as security mechanisms), cryptographic protocols (key agreement, threshold signatures, secure multi-party computation implementations), threat models (adversary capabilities, attack vectors, vulnerability classes), security analysis techniques (formal verification, cryptographic proofs, security auditing), defensive mechanisms (access control, sandboxing, rate limiting, input validation), and realised security properties (collision resistance in specific hash functions, existential unforgeability in signature schemes, semantic security in encryption)

  - ## About SecurityLayer
    id:: security-layer-about
    - The SecurityLayer represents a critical implementation-focused abstraction level that addresses how systems achieve security through concrete mechanisms, protocols, and architectures. Security is not merely a property to be desired (which would be ConceptualLayer) but a set of specific implementations that resist specific threats, prevent specific attacks, and provide specific guarantees. This layer is essential in blockchain and distributed systems because these systems operate in adversarial environments without trusted authorities: participants may be malicious, rational (economically motivated to cheat if profitable), or faulty. Security mechanisms must therefore be robust, verifiable, and economically sound. The SecurityLayer encompasses cryptographic implementations that provide foundational security properties, protocols that coordinate security mechanisms across distributed participants, threat models that characterize adversary capabilities, and defensive architectures that protect against attacks.

    - The layer is organised around several security-focused themes. **Cryptographic implementations** provide the mathematical foundations of blockchain security. Hash functions like SHA-256 and Keccak-256 are not just abstract mathematical functions (ConceptualLayer) but specific implementations with concrete security properties: SHA-256 provides 128-bit collision resistance and 256-bit preimage resistance, enabling secure block linking and address generation. Digital signature schemes like ECDSA and Schnorr signatures provide authentication and non-repudiation through specific elliptic curve implementations, with different tradeoffs: ECDSA has widespread adoption and tooling support but complex implementations vulnerable to implementation errors, while Schnorr signatures offer provable security and signature aggregation but required newer deployment. Zero-knowledge proof systems like zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, and Bulletproofs are sophisticated cryptographic protocols that enable privacy-preserving verification, each with distinct implementation characteristics: zk-SNARKs provide tiny proofs and fast verification but require trusted setup, zk-STARKs eliminate trusted setup with post-quantum security but generate larger proofs, Bulletproofs offer short proofs without trusted setup optimised for range proofs.

    - **Threat models and attack vectors** characterize adversary capabilities and attack strategies that security mechanisms must resist. The 51% attack (attacker controlling majority of mining power or stake) threatens blockchain immutability and enables double-spending, requiring adequate decentralization and economic security. Sybil attacks (attacker creating many identities) threaten decentralized coordination, mitigated by Proof-of-Work (computational cost per identity) or Proof-of-Stake (economic cost per identity). Eclipse attacks (attacker isolating victim nodes from honest network) threaten network-level security, mitigated by robust peer discovery and connection diversity. Smart contract vulnerabilities (reentrancy, integer overflow, access control bugs) threaten application security, mitigated by secure coding practices, formal verification, and security auditing. These threat models are not abstract concerns but concrete attack scenarios with real incidents (the DAO hack via reentrancy, Bitcoin Gold 51% attack, various smart contract exploits totaling billions in losses).

    - **Security protocols and defensive mechanisms** implement specific security strategies. Multi-signature schemes require multiple private keys to authorise transactions, providing security through key distribution and reducing single-point-of-failure risks. Threshold signatures enable k-of-n signature generation, supporting distributed key management and eliminating trust in any single party. Secure multi-party computation enables collaborative computation on private inputs without revealing those inputs, supporting privacy-preserving applications. Access control mechanisms enforce authorization policies, determining who can perform which actions. Rate limiting prevents denial-of-service attacks by constraining resource consumption. Input validation prevents injection attacks by sanitizing external inputs. Sandboxing isolates untrusted code, containing potential exploits. These defensive mechanisms layer to create defence-in-depth: multiple security mechanisms provide redundant protection so single mechanism failure doesn't compromise system security.

    - ### Scope and Boundaries
      - **Included:** Cryptographic implementations and protocols, security mechanisms, threat models, attack vectors, vulnerability classes, security analysis techniques (formal verification, auditing, penetration testing), defensive architectures, security properties as realised through specific implementations, cryptographic security proofs, and security considerations in system design.

      - **Excluded:** Abstract security properties without implementation context (belong in ConceptualLayer), general protocols without security focus (belong in ProtocolLayer), economic security mechanisms (may belong in EconomicLayer), application-level security (may belong in ApplicationLayer), and physical security (belongs in PhysicalLayer).

      - **Boundary Clarifications:** SecurityLayer focuses on security-specific implementations and mechanisms. A concept belongs here if its primary purpose or emphasis is security-related. For example, "SHA-256" belongs in SecurityLayer when discussed as a security mechanism providing collision resistance for block linking. "Consensus Mechanism" belongs primarily in ConceptualLayer or ProtocolLayer but may reference SecurityLayer when discussing security properties of specific implementations. "Smart Contract Vulnerability" belongs in SecurityLayer as it describes security weaknesses. The layer is cross-cutting: concepts from multiple domains (CryptographicDomain, ConsensusDomain, AIEthicsDomain) may have SecurityLayer implementations.

    - ### Relationship to Other Classifications
      - **Relationship to ConceptualLayer:** ConceptualLayer addresses abstract security properties (what it means for a system to be secure, immutable, authentic), while SecurityLayer addresses concrete security implementations (how specific mechanisms achieve these properties). For example, "Collision Resistance" exists conceptually as a desired property of hash functions (ConceptualLayer) and as a proven property of specific hash functions like SHA-256 (SecurityLayer). Many concepts have both conceptual understanding and security implementation.

      - **Relationship to ProtocolLayer:** ProtocolLayer addresses protocol specifications and implementations generally, while SecurityLayer focuses specifically on security aspects. There is significant overlap: security protocols like threshold signatures belong to both SecurityLayer (security mechanism) and ProtocolLayer (protocol specification). The distinction is one of emphasis: if the primary interest is security properties, SecurityLayer is appropriate; if the primary interest is protocol mechanics, ProtocolLayer is appropriate. Many concepts can be classified in both layers.

      - **Cross-Domain Security:** SecurityLayer is cross-cutting, addressing security implementations across all domains. CryptographicDomain concepts (hash functions, signatures) are implemented in SecurityLayer. Consensus mechanisms (ConsensusDomain) have security properties implemented in SecurityLayer. AI systems (AIEthicsDomain) may have security considerations (adversarial robustness, privacy-preserving ML) implemented in SecurityLayer. This cross-domain nature reflects that security is a universal concern across all blockchain and AI systems.

    - ### Design Rationale
      - **Security as Primary Concern:** SecurityLayer was designed as a distinct layer because security is paramount in blockchain and distributed systems operating in adversarial environments without trusted authorities. Systems must resist sophisticated attacks from economically motivated adversaries with significant resources. This security-critical nature justifies dedicated layer classification enabling focused security analysis.

      - **Implementation-Level Focus:** While ConceptualLayer addresses what security properties are desirable, SecurityLayer addresses how those properties are achieved through specific implementations. This implementation focus serves security practitioners, auditors, and researchers who must understand concrete security mechanisms, analyse specific vulnerabilities, and verify security properties of real systems.

      - **Threat-Driven Design:** SecurityLayer organization emphasises threat models and attack vectors, not just security mechanisms. Understanding what attacks are possible and how defences prevent those attacks is essential to security engineering. This threat-driven approach reflects security best practices: design for specific threat models, implement defences against known attacks, and analyse new attack vectors continuously.

      - **Cryptographic Foundation:** SecurityLayer gives significant attention to cryptographic implementations because cryptography provides foundational security properties (integrity through hash functions, authentication through signatures, privacy through encryption and zero-knowledge proofs). The layer includes both standard cryptographic primitives and advanced cryptographic protocols, serving both practitioners using established mechanisms and researchers developing novel cryptographic techniques.

      - **Defence-in-Depth Architecture:** The layer structure recognises that security requires multiple complementary mechanisms (defence-in-depth): cryptographic mechanisms provide foundational security, protocols coordinate security across distributed participants, threat models guide security analysis, and defensive architectures provide layered protection. No single mechanism provides complete security; rather, multiple mechanisms combine to create robust security posture. SecurityLayer captures this multi-faceted security approach.
