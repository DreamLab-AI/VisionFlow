# Display Metrology Ontology Entry – Revised

## Academic Context

- Display metrology represents the scientific discipline of measuring and quantifying the visual output characteristics of electronic displays[6]
  - Defined formally by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) as the science of measurement, embracing both experimental and theoretical determinations across any field of science and technology[6]
  - Encompasses measurement of primary display outputs: brightness, colour, contrast, and other visual qualities through rigorous scientific methodology[6]
  - Distinguishes between two complementary measurement approaches: Spectral Power Distribution (SPD) for absolute electromagnetic output, and Spectral Sensitivity for human perceptual response accounting for the three cone types in the human eye[6]

## Current Landscape (2025)

- Standards and measurement frameworks
  - The Information Display Measurements Standard (IDMS) v1.3 was released in May 2025 by the International Committee for Display Metrology (ICDM), part of the Society for Information Display (SID)[1][2]
  - IDMS v1.3 comprises over 900 pages of display measurement methods and tutorials, representing the culmination of collaborative effort by display metrologists, engineers, physicists, and vision scientists across dozens of organisations[1][2]
  - The standard encompasses approximately 140 display measurements covering every area of displays, intended for multiple user types from manufacturers to consumers[1][7]
  - ICDM explicitly does not set compliance values; this responsibility falls to other standards organisations[1][7]
  - Notable additions in v1.3 include extensive material on camera setup and imaging light devices with moiré reduction techniques, concentric ring imaging for Michelson contrast measurement on near-eye displays, temperature stabilisation protocols for HDR displays, and updated colour metrology content including uniform colour spaces and colour difference equations[2]
  - New computational resources include code supporting gamut ring analysis for reflective displays and bidirectional scatter distribution function analysis[2]

- Technical capabilities and measurement approaches
  - Display metrology quantifies visual performance through standardised instrumentation including spectrophotometers, photometers, and imaging systems[6]
  - Modern measurement frameworks accommodate diverse display technologies from traditional LCD and OLED to emerging near-eye and reflective display systems[1][2]
  - Measurement protocols address both objective physical characteristics and human perceptual response, recognising that visual perception involves complex cone sensitivity across the electromagnetic spectrum[6]

- UK and North England context
  - The search results do not identify specific display metrology research centres or implementations within North England or the broader UK context; however, the ICDM's international composition suggests potential participation from British institutions and manufacturers in standards development

  - Radiant Vision Systems. (2025). *Display Metrology: The Science of Quality Measurement*. Technical overview of spectral power distribution and spectral sensitivity in display measurement.[6]

- Emerging research directions
  - Digitisation of metrology data: BIPM's Forum on Metrology and Digitalization (2025) emphasises the integration of AI, automation, and digital infrastructures with measurement science, requiring adherence to FAIR principles (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, Reusability) for measurement data[5]
  - Diffractive component characterisation: Recent work (2025) addresses measurement and characterisation of diffractive components in display reflection, indicating expansion into optical phenomena previously less systematically addressed[4]

## Future Directions

- Emerging technical frontiers
  - Expansion of measurement protocols for advanced display technologies, particularly near-eye displays and reflective display systems requiring novel measurement geometries[2]
  - Integration of artificial intelligence and machine-readable measurement data formats to enable cross-border comparability and seamless integration into digital regulatory frameworks[5]
  - Development of standardised approaches to temperature-dependent display characterisation, particularly for HDR and high-performance displays[2]

- Research priorities
  - Harmonisation of digital measurement data formats across international standards bodies to prevent ecosystem fragmentation[5]
  - Refinement of optical measurement techniques for emerging display technologies that challenge conventional measurement assumptions
  - Continued evolution of human visual response modelling to account for advances in display technology and viewing conditions

## Notes on Revision

The original definition conflated display metrology (the science of measurement) with measurement instrumentation. The revised entry clarifies that display metrology is a disciplinary approach encompassing standardised methods, frameworks, and scientific principles—of which instruments are merely tools. The current definition was overly narrow and equipment-focused, whereas display metrology encompasses theoretical foundations, standardisation efforts, and evolving measurement methodologies. The 2025 release of IDMS v1.3 represents a significant development warranting inclusion, though time-sensitive announcements regarding release dates have been contextualised appropriately. UK-specific context remains limited in available literature; this reflects genuine gaps in the search results rather than oversight.
