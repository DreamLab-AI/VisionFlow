## Key Characteristics

### Privacy Principles (ISO/IEC 29100)

#### 1. Consent

**Definition**: Informed, freely given, specific consent for data processing

**AI Context**:
- Consent for data collection and training
- Understanding of AI processing
- Withdrawal of consent mechanisms

**Example**: User opts in to facial recognition with full understanding

#### 2. Purpose Limitation

**Definition**: Data collected for specified, explicit, legitimate purposes only

**AI Context**:
- Training data used only for stated purpose
- No function creep
- Purpose documented and communicated

**Example**: Medical data collected for diagnosis not used for insurance

#### 3. Data Minimization

**Definition**: Collect only data necessary for purpose

**AI Context**:
- Feature selection that respects privacy
- Avoid collecting "just in case" data
- Minimal retention periods

**Example**: Credit scoring using only relevant financial data, not full browsing history

#### 4. Use Limitation

**Definition**: Data used only for specified purposes

**AI Context**:
- Model trained for stated purpose only
- No secondary uses without consent
- Purpose-bound data use

#### 5. Individual Participation

**Definition**: Individuals have rights over their data

**GDPR Rights**:
- Right to access (Article 15)
- Right to rectification (Article 16)
- Right to erasure/"right to be forgotten" (Article 17)
- Right to data portability (Article 20)
- Right to object (Article 21)
- Rights related to automated decision-making (Article 22)

#### 6. Accountability

**Definition**: Demonstrate compliance with privacy principles

**AI Context**:
- Privacy impact assessments
- Documentation of data processing
- Privacy by design and default

#### 7. Security Safeguards

- See Security (AI-0071)

## Privacy Risks in AI

### Data Collection Risks

1. **Overcollection**
   - Collecting more data than necessary
   - Example: Smart speaker always listening

2. **Secondary Use**
   - Using data for purposes beyond original consent
   - Example: Training data repurposed for advertising

3. **Surveillance**
   - Pervasive monitoring
   - Example: Facial recognition in public spaces

### Data Processing Risks

4. **Re-identification**
   - Anonymized data linked back to individuals
   - Example: Netflix Prize dataset de-anonymization

5. **Inference Attacks**
   - Deriving sensitive information not explicitly provided
   - Example: Inferring health conditions from purchase history

6. **Model Inversion** (AI-0087)
   - Reconstructing training data from model
   - Example: Extracting faces from facial recognition model

7. **Membership Inference** (AI-0088)
   - Determining if individual's data in training set
   - Example: Was this patient in medical training data?

### Data Sharing Risks

8. **Unauthorized Disclosure**
   - Sharing data without authorization
   - Example: Data broker selling personal information

9. **Cross-Border Transfers**
   - Data transferred to jurisdictions with weaker protections
   - GDPR Chapter V requirements

## Privacy-Preserving Techniques

### Anonymization and De-identification

1. **K-Anonymity**
   - Each record indistinguishable from k-1 others
   - Protects against re-identification
   - **Limitation**: Vulnerable to homogeneity and background knowledge attacks

2. **L-Diversity**
   - Extends k-anonymity
   - Ensures diversity of sensitive attributes
   - **Limitation**: May not prevent attribute disclosure

3. **T-Closeness**
   - Distribution of sensitive attribute close to overall distribution
   - Stronger than l-diversity

### Differential Privacy

**Definition**: Formal mathematical guarantee that individual's data has negligible impact on query results

**Mechanism**:
```
DP-Query(database, query) = TrueAnswer(query) + Noise
```

**ε-Differential Privacy**:
For neighboring datasets D and D' differing by one record:
```
P(M(D) ∈ S) ≤ e^ε × P(M(D') ∈ S)
```

**Properties**:
- Composability: Privacy budgets combine
- Post-processing immunity: Cannot reverse DP
- Group privacy: Protects groups

**AI Applications**:
- Differentially private SGD (DP-SGD)
- Private model training
- Noisy aggregation in federated learning

**Example**:
```python
def dp_sgd(data, model, epsilon, delta):
    # Clip gradients
    clipped_grads = clip_gradients(compute_grads(data, model))
    # Add calibrated noise
    noise = gaussian_noise(sensitivity / epsilon)
    noisy_grads = clipped_grads + noise
    # Update model
    model.update(noisy_grads)
```

### Federated Learning

**Definition**: Train models on decentralized data without centralising raw data

**Process**:
1. Server sends model to clients
2. Clients train on local data
3. Clients send model updates (not data) to server
4. Server aggregates updates

**Privacy Benefits**:
- Raw data stays on device
- Only model updates transmitted
- Can combine with differential privacy

**Challenges**:
- Model inversion attacks still possible
- Communication overhead
- Heterogeneous data distributions

**Applications**: Mobile keyboard prediction, healthcare collaborations

### Homomorphic Encryption

**Definition**: Computation on encrypted data without decryption

**Types**:
- **Partially Homomorphic**: One operation (addition or multiplication)
- **Somewhat Homomorphic**: Limited operations
- **Fully Homomorphic**: Arbitrary computations

**AI Applications**:
- Encrypted model inference
- Privacy-preserving predictions
- Secure multi-party computation

**Limitation**: Computationally expensive

### Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC)

**Definition**: Multiple parties jointly compute function without revealing inputs

**Applications**:
- Collaborative model training
- Private data pooling
- Secure aggregation

**Techniques**:
- Secret sharing
- Garbled circuits
- Oblivious transfer
