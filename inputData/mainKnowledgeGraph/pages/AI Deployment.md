  - **Definition**
    - definition:: AI Deployment refers to the comprehensive phase of the AI lifecycle in which a developed, validated, and tested artificial intelligence system is integrated into operational production environments, transitioned from development to live operational use, and made available to end users, encompassing coordinated activities including system integration with existing infrastructure and workflows, operational infrastructure provisioning (compute resources, storage, networking, monitoring systems), release management and version control, configuration management ensuring proper system parameters, user training and documentation delivery, operational support structure establishment including helpdesk and incident response procedures, performance monitoring and observability instrumentation, security hardening and access control implementation, and regulatory compliance verification to ensure reliable, safe, effective, and compliant system functioning in real-world conditions. This critical transition involves deployment strategies including canary releases (gradual rollout to subset of users), blue-green deployments (maintaining parallel environments for zero-downtime switching), A/B testing for performance comparison, and shadow mode where AI recommendations are generated but not acted upon initially to validate behavior before full activation. Key deployment considerations address scalability ensuring system handles anticipated load, latency requirements for real-time applications, model serving infrastructure (batch inference vs real-time serving), data pipeline integration connecting deployed models to production data sources, model versioning and rollback capabilities enabling rapid reversion if issues arise, monitoring dashboards tracking performance metrics, drift detection, and operational health, security measures including authentication, authorization, encryption, and audit logging, and governance controls implementing human oversight, approval workflows, and compliance documentation. Deployment challenges include production-development environment parity ensuring consistent behavior, dependency management for model artifacts and libraries, resource optimization balancing cost and performance, and continuous deployment (MLOps) pipeline automation enabling rapid iteration while maintaining safety and quality, governed by emerging standards including ISO/IEC 42001:2023 AI management systems and practices defined in EU AI Act Article 9 for high-risk systems.

## AI Deployment

AI Deployment refers to the phase of the ai lifecycle in which a developed and validated artificial intelligence system is integrated into operational environments, made available to end users, and transitioned from development to production use, encompassing activities such as system integration, infrastructure provisioning, release management, user training, documentation delivery, and the establishment of operational support structures to ensure reliable, safe, and effective system functioning in real-world conditions.

- AI deployment has accelerated globally, with adoption outpacing governance and responsible AI maturity.
  - Industries leading adoption include technology, finance, and manufacturing, with increasing use of advanced agentic and multimodal AI systems.
  - Deployment activities now routinely involve automation of workflows, cloud infrastructure provisioning, and operational monitoring to ensure reliability and safety.
- Notable organisations driving deployment include Microsoft, Google, and Anthropic, with platforms supporting scalable AI integration.
- In the UK, AI deployment is supported by national strategies emphasising responsible innovation and infrastructure development.
- Technical capabilities have advanced to support adaptive AI systems that can operate autonomously post-deployment, but challenges remain in governance, risk management, and operational transparency.
- Standards and frameworks such as the EU Artificial Intelligence Act define key terms and regulatory expectations for AI deployment, focusing on risk and accountability.
