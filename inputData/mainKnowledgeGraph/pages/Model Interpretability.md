## Model Interpretability

Model Interpretability refers to the degree to which a human can understand the cause-effect relationships within a machine learning model's decision-making process, encompassing both the model's internal mechanisms and the reasoning behind specific predictions.

- Industry adoption and implementations
  - Major cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) offer built-in interpretability tools and services
  - Financial institutions, healthcare providers, and public sector organisations increasingly require interpretable models for regulatory compliance and stakeholder trust
- Notable organisations and platforms
  - AWS SageMaker Clarify, Azure Machine Learning Interpretability, Google Cloud AI Explanations
  - UK-based companies such as BenevolentAI, Faculty, and Babylon Health have integrated interpretability into their AI products
- UK and North England examples where relevant
  - The Alan Turing Institute in London leads national research on AI interpretability
  - Manchester’s Digital Health Centre of Excellence uses interpretable models for clinical decision support
  - Leeds City Council has piloted interpretable AI for social services allocation
  - Newcastle University’s Institute for Data Science applies interpretability in smart city initiatives
  - Sheffield’s Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC) uses interpretable models for predictive maintenance
- Technical capabilities and limitations
  - Intrinsic interpretability is achievable with simple models (linear regression, decision trees), but often at the cost of predictive performance
  - Post-hoc methods (SHAP, LIME, PDPs) can provide insights into complex models, but may not capture all nuances of the decision process
  - Interpretability remains a challenge for deep learning and ensemble methods
- Standards and frameworks
  - The IEEE P7001 standard for transparency in autonomous systems includes interpretability requirements
  - The UK’s Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation (CDEI) has published guidance on AI transparency and interpretability
