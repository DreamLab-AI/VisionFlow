## Verifiable Credentials

Verifiable Credentials refers to a component of the blockchain ecosystem.

- Industry adoption of VCs has accelerated across sectors such as education, healthcare, finance, and government services, driven by the need for tamper-proof, instantly verifiable digital credentials.
  - Leading platforms implement W3C standards, enabling issuers, holders, and verifiers to interact securely via decentralised wallets.
  - Notable organisations include Sphereon, Northern Block, and Spherity, with implementations aligned to EU regulations like eIDAS 2.0 and the European Digital Identity Wallet.
- In the UK, and particularly North England cities such as Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield, universities and professional bodies are increasingly adopting blockchain-based VCs to streamline certification and reduce fraud.
- Technical capabilities:
  - VCs provide cryptographic proof of authenticity and integrity, support selective disclosure to enhance privacy, and enable instant verification replacing traditional slow processes.
  - Limitations include interoperability challenges due to multiple DID methods and credential formats, and ongoing evolution of revocation and key management mechanisms.
- Standards and frameworks continue to evolve, with W3C VC Data Model 2.0 as the core specification, complemented by emerging protocols like KERI and did:web aiming to simplify decentralised identity without blockchain dependency.

- Ongoing research focuses on enhancing privacy via zero-knowledge proofs, improving usability for non-technical users, and developing standardised revocation methods.

## UK Context

- The UK government and academic institutions have shown strong interest in VCs for digital identity and qualification verification, with pilot projects in collaboration with industry partners.
- North England innovation hubs such as Manchester’s Digital Futures, Leeds Digital Festival, and Newcastle’s Blockchain Centre are fostering VC-related startups and research.
- Regional case studies include the University of Leeds issuing blockchain-verified diplomas and Sheffield’s NHS Trust exploring privacy-preserving health credentials.
- British contributions also include active participation in W3C working groups and development of open-source VC wallets tailored to UK regulatory requirements.

## Future Directions

- Emerging trends:
  - Integration of VCs with AI-driven identity verification and biometric authentication.
  - Expansion of VC use cases into supply chain provenance, professional licencing, and cross-border travel credentials.
- Anticipated challenges:
  - Achieving widespread interoperability amid diverse DID methods and credential formats.
  - Balancing privacy with regulatory compliance, especially post-Brexit data protection nuances.
- Research priorities:
  - Developing user-friendly VC management tools.
  - Enhancing revocation and key rotation protocols.
  - Investigating non-blockchain decentralised identity mechanisms for scalability and simplicity.
