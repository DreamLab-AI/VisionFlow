## FRAME Reporting Framework (Implementation Science)

FRAME (Framework for Reporting Adaptations and Modifications) refers to systematic methodologies for documenting modifications to evidence-based interventions and implementation strategies in healthcare settings. Two primary frameworks exist: the original FRAME for reporting adaptations to interventions, and FRAME-IS for documenting modifications to implementation strategies.

The expanded FRAME includes eight core components: (1) timing and implementation stage of modifications, (2) whether modifications were planned/proactive or unplanned/reactive, (3) decision-makers determining modifications, (4) what elements were modified, (5) delivery level of modifications, (6) type of context or content-level modifications, (7) fidelity-consistency of modifications, and (8) rationale for modifications. FRAME-IS extends this framework specifically for implementation strategies, enabling healthcare system leaders and implementation scientists to systematically document how strategies adapt across different settings and populations.

These frameworks address critical gaps in implementation science by providing standardized reporting mechanisms that allow researchers to understand the relationship between modifications and health outcomes. FRAME reporting supports evidence synthesis, meta-analysis, and knowledge translation by ensuring transparent documentation of how interventions evolve during real-world implementation. The frameworks are widely used in UK healthcare research and internationally to improve the precision and reproducibility of implementation science studies.
