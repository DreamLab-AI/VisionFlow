## Ethical AI

Ethical AI refers to the development, deployment, and use of artificial intelligence systems in accordance with moral principles and values that respect human dignity, rights, and wellbeing, incorporating considerations of fairness, transparency, accountability, privacy, safety, and beneficence throughout the ai lifecycle, whilst promoting human flourishing, social justice, and the common good through deliberate design choices, governance mechanisms, and operational practices that embed ethical reasoning into ai system functioning and organisational decision-making.

- Industry adoption and implementations
  - Ethical AI is now a core component of corporate strategy, particularly in sectors such as finance, healthcare, retail, and public services
  - Notable organisations and platforms
    - IBM’s AI Ethics Board and Responsible AI Toolkit
    - Google’s Responsible AI Practices and AI Principles
    - Microsoft’s AI for Good initiative
    - UK and North England examples where relevant
      - Manchester Metropolitan University’s Centre for Digital Ethics and Society
      - Leeds City Council’s AI Ethics Advisory Panel
      - Newcastle University’s Institute for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence
      - Sheffield Hallam University’s Centre for Social Informatics
  - Technical capabilities and limitations
    - Advances in explainable AI (XAI) and fairness-aware machine learning have improved transparency and reduced bias
    - Limitations remain in areas such as real-time monitoring, dynamic risk assessment, and cross-jurisdictional compliance
  - Standards and frameworks
    - ISO/IEC 42001:2023 – Artificial Intelligence Management System
    - IEEE P7000 series – Ethical Considerations in System Design
    - UK’s AI Standards Hub and the Alan Turing Institute’s AI Ethics Guidelines
