### Relationships
- is-subclass-of:: [[AIGovernance]]
	- definition:: The challenge and process of ensuring AI systems pursue objectives that align with human values, even as those systems become more capable and autonomous. Value alignment addresses both technical and philosophical questions about encoding human preferences into AI behaviour.

## Academic Context

- Value alignment represents a fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence safety and ethics
  - Emerged as critical research area alongside exponential growth in AI capabilities
  - Addresses the gap between AI system objectives and genuine human values and intentions
  - Encompasses both technical encoding problems and deeper philosophical questions about what constitutes "human values"
- The field distinguishes between thin and thick alignment
  - Thin alignment: AI systems superficially meeting human-specified criteria
  - Thick alignment: deeper, contextual understanding of human values across diverse real-world scenarios
  - Recognition that alignment requirements vary significantly by use case and cultural context

## Current Landscape (2025)

- Core principles guiding alignment research
  - Robustness: reliable behaviour across edge cases and novel scenarios
  - Interpretability: human-understandable decision-making processes
  - Value alignment: training systems to pursue outcomes aligned with human ethical standards and societal norms
  - Scalability: mechanisms that function for both current and future, more powerful models
  - Continual oversight: human feedback loops enabling adaptive behaviour over time
  - Controllability and ethicality (RICE framework)
- Industry implementation and technical approaches
  - Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) as primary fine-tuning methodology
  - Synthetic data approaches and red teaming for robustness testing
  - Leading organisations: OpenAI, DeepMind, Anthropic, IBM
  - Application domains: healthcare diagnostics, autonomous systems, generative AI chatbots
- UK and North England context
  - Growing alignment research capacity within UK universities and research institutions
  - Regulatory frameworks: EU AI Act compliance considerations for UK organisations post-Brexit
  - Healthcare sector particularly engaged with alignment challenges (NHS AI implementation considerations)
- Technical challenges and limitations
  - Operationalising abstract ethical principles into verifiable technical specifications remains difficult
  - Tension between competing values (e.g., privacy versus transparency in healthcare contexts)
  - Difficulty anticipating outcomes as AI models increase in complexity and autonomy
  - The "AI alignment problem": challenge of controlling increasingly advanced systems
  - Superalignment concerns regarding hypothetical artificial superintelligence (ASI) systems
