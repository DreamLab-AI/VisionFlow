**Inference** is the process of applying an AI system to produce results. The act of using a trained model to make predictions or generate outputs on new, unseen data. Refers both to the process and its result, with premises being a fact, rule, model, feature, or raw data.

		  ### Primary Definition
		  **Inference** is the process of applying an AI system to produce results. The act of using a trained model to make predictions or generate outputs on new, unseen data. Refers both to the process and its result, with premises being a fact, rule, model, feature, or raw data.
		
		  **Source**: ISO/IEC 22989:2022, Clause 3.3.4 - Authority Score: 0.95
		
		  ### Operational Characteristics
		  - **Model Application**: Uses trained model on new inputs
		  - **Real-Time Processing**: Typically requires low latency
		  - **No Learning**: Model parameters remain fixed
		  - **Production Phase**: Deployed model serving predictions
		  - **Scalability Critical**: Must handle high request volumes
		
		  ## Relationships
		
		  ### Parent Classes
		  - **Machine Learning Process**: Inference is a core ML operation
		  - **Deployment Phase**: Occurs after training completion
		
		  ### Related Concepts
		  - **Training** (AI-0041): Contrasting process (creating vs using model)
		  - **Model** (AI-0004): Inference applies trained models
		  - **Prediction**: Common inference output type
		  - **Deployment**: Context where inference occurs
		  - **Runtime Performance**: Inference speed and throughput
