## Computer Vision

Computer Vision refers to computer vision is the field of artificial intelligence concerned with enabling machines to interpret, understand, and process visual information from the world, emulating human visual perception capabilities. computer vision encompasses image classification, object detection, segmentation, tracking, 3d reconstruction, and visual reasoning using deep learning architectures, particularly convolutional neural networks, to extract meaningful information from digital images and video.

- Computer vision is widely adopted across industries including healthcare, automotive, retail, security, and manufacturing.
  - Leading platforms and frameworks such as OpenCV, TensorFlow, and PyTorch facilitate CV development and deployment.
  - Real-time object detection, pose estimation, and facial recognition are among the most mature applications.
- UK and North England have active industry and academic participation:
  - Manchester and Leeds host research groups advancing CV algorithms and applications, often in collaboration with local tech companies.
  - Newcastle and Sheffield contribute through innovation in industrial automation and healthcare imaging.
- Technical capabilities:
  - State-of-the-art CV systems achieve high accuracy in controlled environments but still face challenges with domain adaptation, occlusion, and interpretability.
  - Edge AI is increasingly used for real-time processing on devices with limited connectivity.
- Standards and frameworks:
  - Ethical guidelines and data privacy regulations shape CV deployment, especially concerning facial recognition and surveillance.
  - Open standards for data formats and interoperability are evolving to support multi-vendor ecosystems.
