## Multi Head Attention

Multi Head Attention refers to an extension of the attention mechanism that allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions, using multiple attention heads in parallel.

- Industry adoption and implementations
  - Multi-head attention is a key component in state-of-the-art models such as BERT, GPT, and T5, which are used for a wide range of tasks including language understanding, translation, and text generation
  - Major technology companies and research institutions, including Google, Meta, and Microsoft, have integrated multi-head attention into their models and platforms
- Notable organisations and platforms
  - Google's BERT and T5 models
  - Meta's Llama series
  - Microsoft's Azure AI and Cognitive Services
- UK and North England examples where relevant
  - The University of Manchester has been active in research on transformer models and attention mechanisms, with contributions to both theoretical and applied aspects
  - Leeds and Newcastle have seen growing interest in natural language processing and machine learning, with local startups and research groups exploring the use of multi-head attention in various applications
  - Sheffield's Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC) has begun to explore the use of attention mechanisms in industrial automation and robotics
- Technical capabilities and limitations
  - Multi-head attention enables models to capture complex dependencies and patterns in data, but it can be computationally expensive, especially for long sequences
  - Variants such as grouped-query attention and multi-head latent attention have been developed to address some of these limitations, improving efficiency and performance
- Standards and frameworks
  - The PyTorch and TensorFlow libraries provide built-in support for multi-head attention, making it accessible to researchers and practitioners
  - The Hugging Face Transformers library offers pre-trained models and tools for working with multi-head attention
