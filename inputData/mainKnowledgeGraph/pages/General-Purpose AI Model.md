## General Purpose AI Model

General Purpose AI Model refers to an ai model that displays significant generality and is capable of competently performing a wide range of distinct tasks regardless of the way the model is placed on the market.

- Industry adoption and implementations
	- Major tech companies and startups globally deploy GPAI models for applications ranging from chatbots to content generation
	- Notable organisations and platforms
		- OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, and Meta are leading providers of GPAI models
		- UK-based companies such as DeepMind (London) and Faculty (London) are active in this space
	- UK and North England examples where relevant
		- The Alan Turing Institute (London) collaborates with regional hubs in Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield on AI research and deployment
		- The Northern AI Cluster, centred in Manchester, fosters innovation in AI applications for healthcare, finance, and public services
- Technical capabilities and limitations
	- GPAI models excel at tasks such as text generation, image synthesis, and multimodal reasoning
	- Limitations include high computational costs, potential for bias, and challenges in interpretability
- Standards and frameworks
	- The EU AI Act sets a threshold for GPAI models based on training compute (10^23 FLOP)
	- The General-Purpose AI Code of Practice provides voluntary guidelines for responsible development and deployment
	- The UK’s AI Standards Hub promotes best practices and interoperability
