## Query Key Value

Query Key Value refers to the three fundamental components in attention mechanisms: queries determine what information to seek, keys determine what information is available, and values contain the actual information to be retrieved.

- Industry adoption of QKV-based attention mechanisms is ubiquitous in large language models (LLMs), machine translation, summarisation, and beyond.
  - Multi-head attention, an extension of the QKV mechanism, allows simultaneous focus on multiple aspects of input data, enhancing model expressivity and robustness.
  - Leading platforms such as OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Meta employ variants of QKV attention in their state-of-the-art models.
- In the UK, several AI research groups and companies integrate QKV attention mechanisms into their NLP pipelines.
  - Notable examples include the Alan Turing Institute in London and AI startups in Manchester and Leeds focusing on language understanding and healthcare applications.
- Technical capabilities:
  - QKV attention enables efficient parallelisation and scalability compared to traditional recurrent models.
  - Limitations include quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length, prompting research into sparse and linearised attention variants.
- Standards and frameworks:
  - Transformer-based architectures leveraging QKV attention are standardised in popular libraries such as Hugging Face Transformers and TensorFlow.
  - Open research continues to refine attention mechanisms for efficiency and interpretability.
