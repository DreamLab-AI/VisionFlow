## Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)

Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) refers to autonomous governance entity operating through rules encoded in smart contracts, enabling collective decision-making, treasury management, and organizational operations without centralized authority.

- Industry adoption and implementations
	- DAOs are widely used in decentralised finance (DeFi), NFT projects, and community-driven initiatives
	- Notable organisations and platforms include Uniswap, Synthetix, and MakerDAO, which have established robust governance models and large member bases
	- In the UK, DAOs are gaining traction in fintech, creative industries, and social enterprises, with several projects emerging from Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield
- UK and North England examples where relevant
	- Manchester-based DAOs are active in the fintech and blockchain sectors, leveraging the city's strong tech ecosystem
	- Leeds has seen the rise of DAOs focused on community development and local innovation, often collaborating with universities and local authorities
	- Newcastle and Sheffield are home to DAOs exploring applications in digital art, education, and social impact, benefiting from regional innovation hubs and supportive local policies
- Technical capabilities and limitations
	- DAOs offer transparent, automated governance through smart contracts, enabling efficient decision-making and resource allocation
	- Limitations include scalability issues, regulatory uncertainty, and the potential for governance attacks or centralisation of voting power
- Standards and frameworks
	- Industry standards for DAO governance are still evolving, with ongoing efforts to establish best practices for transparency, security, and member participation
	- Frameworks such as the DAOstack and Aragon are widely used to facilitate the creation and management of DAOs
