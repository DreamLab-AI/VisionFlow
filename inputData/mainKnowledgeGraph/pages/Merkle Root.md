## Merkle Root

Merkle Root refers to top hash of merkle tree within blockchain systems, providing essential functionality for distributed ledger technology operations and properties.

- Industry adoption and implementations
	- Notable organisations and platforms
		- Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to use Merkle roots in their block headers for transaction commitment and state verification.
		- Layer 2 solutions such as Optimism, Arbitrum, and zkSync rely on Merkle roots for rollup state commitments and fraud proofs.
		- Decentralised exchanges and DeFi protocols use Merkle roots for proof-of-reserves and off-chain attestations.
	- UK and North England examples where relevant
		- UK-based blockchain startups, including those in Manchester and Leeds, are integrating Merkle roots into their smart contract platforms and audit tools.
		- The Newcastle Blockchain Research Centre has published work on Merkle-based privacy-preserving protocols for supply chain applications.
	- Technical capabilities and limitations
		- Merkle roots allow for efficient, scalable verification of large datasets, but are limited by the underlying hash function’s collision resistance.
		- The structure is vulnerable to certain quantum attacks, prompting research into post-quantum alternatives.
	- Standards and frameworks
		- The Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) process has formalised the use of Merkle roots in state and transaction commitments.
		- The Bitcoin Core documentation and BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals) provide detailed specifications for Merkle tree construction.
