- ##### VisionFlow: Connect
	- Telepresence System
- VisionFlow: Connect is a breakthrough system in the film industry that
  brings remote directors to the heart of production using augmented
  reality technology. This is achieved through an innovative application
  of the Apple Vision Pro AR headset.
- In the VisionFlow: Connect system, the director, located remotely, wears
  an AR headset and navigates along a marked line. This line mirrors the
  inward-facing edge of a large-scale, wrap-around LED virtual production
  facility. Within the LED volume, participants can view the director’s
  avatar, providing a sense of spatial consistency and our work
  interaction, crucial for effective direction.
- A novel technique, "ghost frame" by Helios, is employed to prevent the
  camera within the LED volume from capturing the director’s remote avatar
  on the LED wall. This ensures the director’s virtual presence doesn’t
  interfere with the recorded footage.
- The benefits of VisionFlow: Connect are multifold. It allows senior
  stakeholders to manage their time more efficiently as they can direct
  remotely without needing to be physically present on multiple sets.
  Directors can interact in real-time, giving instantaneous feedback and
  adjustments. It also enhances directors’ spatial awareness of the scene,
  thereby improving the decision-making process.
