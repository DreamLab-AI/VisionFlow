- ### Custom models
	- AI/ML is the high interest rate credit card of product development
	- The likely emerging trend for [[Large language models]] is small models optimised for your data, with API collaboration and support from a big foundational model.
	- Think [[Mistral]], replacing one of the experts with YOUR expert
	- This is kinda true for image and video too, in that you can blend workflows between powerful online systems and more nuanced personal models. (imagebashing).
	- ### How to train models?
		- Smaller data and workflows:
			- Do it yourself with suitable cloud hardware. This applies to all Gen AI.
			- [[LoRA DoRA etc]] are very accessible. Basically nudge the existing models for your requirements.
			- Low legal peril.
		- Medium scale problems:
			- Own the skills you need for your data / product problem.
			- There's a lot of guidance from the major players like Microsoft
			  [Develop Generative AI solutions with Azure OpenAI Service
		- Training | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/develop-ai-solutions-azure-openai/)
			- Get in a private consultant like me and onboard the skills for your product / data problem
			- This is the same model a the hub and spokes needed for larger models
		- Large / complex product and data challenges:
			- The industry is set up around the necessary datacentres. These are centres of excellence, commercial labs, Universities, etc.
			- Engage commercial data team who get you up to speed and train your model on their hardware.

	- ### Roll out in the cloud.
	- Play with [Runpod](https://www.runpod.io/). There's some great [YouTube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjiX3lCnwUI)
	- I use a [Lambda Labs H100](https://lambdalabs.com/).
	- Unless you really know what you're doing, or you have a LOT of data, I wouldn't buy GPUs and attempt the inferencing side yourself
