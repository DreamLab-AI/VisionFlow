## Motion Planning

Motion Planning refers to motion planning extends path planning by incorporating robot dynamics, control constraints, and time-parametrisation to generate dynamically feasible trajectories that account for velocity, acceleration, jerk, and actuator limitations. motion planning produces executable control sequences that guide robots and autonomous vehicles from initial to goal states whilst satisfying kinodynamic constraints and optimising performance metrics.

- Motion planning is widely adopted across robotics sectors, including autonomous vehicles, industrial automation, robotic manipulation, and service robots.
  - Notable platforms include ROS (Robot Operating System) with integrated motion planning frameworks like MoveIt!, and commercial autonomous vehicle systems that rely heavily on trajectory planning.
  - In industrial settings, motion planning algorithms enable robots to operate safely and efficiently in complex, dynamic environments, such as CNC machine tending and warehouse automation.
- Technical capabilities now routinely handle high-dimensional configuration spaces, dynamic obstacles, and uncertainty, leveraging sampling-based planners (e.g., RRT*, PRM) and optimisation-based trajectory planners.
- Limitations remain in real-time replanning under severe uncertainty and in guaranteeing global optimality for highly complex systems.
- Standards and frameworks continue to evolve, with ISO 8373 defining robot terminology and ISO 13482 addressing safety requirements for personal care robots, influencing motion planning safety criteria.
