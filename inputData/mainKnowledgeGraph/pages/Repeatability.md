I appreciate the detailed request, but I must clarify an important limitation: you've asked me to review and improve an ontology entry, yet no current definition has been provided in your query. The instruction states "CURRENT DEFINITION: ### Primary Definition" followed immediately by a filename, with no actual content to review.

To provide the comprehensive, technically rigorous update you've requested—complete with UK context, North England examples, full academic citations, and Logseq formatting—I would need to see the existing definition you wish me to improve.

However, I can offer what the updated structure should contain, based on the search results and your specifications:

## Academic Context

- Repeatability defined as the ability of a measurement or experimental procedure to produce consistent results when performed multiple times under identical conditions
  - Same operator, equipment, location, and short time intervals maintained
  - Quantifies the extent to which repeated experimental results agree with one another
  - Distinct from reproducibility (which involves new data) and replicability (which involves different research teams)

## Current Landscape (2025)

- Industrial and scientific applications
  - Manufacturing quality control and product consistency
  - Clinical laboratory diagnostics and medical testing
  - Regulatory compliance across sectors
- Technical precision considerations
  - Measurement system validation
  - Experimental approach verification
  - Controlled variable management
