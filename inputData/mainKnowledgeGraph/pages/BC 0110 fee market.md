- ## About BC 0110 Fee Market

### Primary Definition

The Bitcoin fee market is an economic mechanism where users compete for limited block space by offering transaction fees to miners. Fees are determined by network congestion, transaction size (in virtual bytes), and user urgency, creating a dynamic auction system that allocates blockchain resources efficiently. This market emerged as Bitcoin's adoption grew and block space became scarce, transforming from a system with minimal or zero fees into a sophisticated price discovery mechanism.

## Historical Evolution (2009-2025)

### Early Free Transaction Period (2009-2012)

In Bitcoin's earliest years, transactions were often free or included only nominal fees, as block space was plentiful and user adoption was low. Satoshi Nakamoto's original client allowed for zero-fee transactions if they met certain criteria, such as being small in size and not spending recently received coins. During this period, miners were incentivized primarily by block rewards rather than transaction fees, as the 50 BTC block reward vastly exceeded any fee revenue.

The Bitcoin protocol initially included anti-spam measures that allowed some transactions to bypass fees entirely, provided they met size and priority thresholds. This approach worked well when network usage was minimal, but it became unsustainable as adoption increased.

### Introduction of Fees and Fee Market (2013-2016)

As Bitcoin's popularity grew, miners began prioritizing transactions with higher fees to maximise their revenue, especially as blocks started to fill. By 2013, the average transaction fee was still under $0.10, but by 2016, it had risen to approximately $0.20-$0.30 as competition for block space increased. This period marked the transition from a subsidy-dominated miner revenue model to one where fees began to play a meaningful role.

The growing fee market led to the development of the first fee estimation algorithms in popular wallets, allowing users to set appropriate fees based on network conditions rather than arbitrary amounts.

### Fee Market Crisis and Scaling Debates (2017)

In 2017, Bitcoin experienced its first major fee market crisis. Average transaction fees spiked above $50 during periods of extreme congestion, notably in December 2017 during the bull market and ICO boom. Peak fees exceeded $55 per transaction, pricing out many users from using Bitcoin for everyday payments.

This crisis led to widespread debate about Bitcoin's scalability and usability for small payments. The community split over how to address the issue, with some advocating for larger blocks and others supporting second-layer solutions. The high fees demonstrated both the limitations of Bitcoin's base layer and the effectiveness of the fee market as a resource allocation mechanism.

### Segregated Witness (SegWit) Adoption (2017-2020) [Updated 2025]

The Segregated Witness ([[SegWit]]) upgrade was activated in August 2017, increasing effective block capacity and enabling more efficient transaction formats. SegWit separated signature data from transaction data, effectively increasing the block size limit from 1 MB to approximately 4 MB (measured in weight units). More importantly, it fixed transaction malleability, enabling second-layer solutions like the [[Lightning Network]].

SegWit adoption gradually increased from under 10% in late 2017 to over 85% by 2025, helping to reduce average fees and smooth out fee volatility. By 2019-2020, average fees had stabilized in the $1-$3 range, except during brief periods of congestion. The widespread adoption of native SegWit addresses (bech32 format starting with "bc1") became standard practice among exchanges and wallets by 2022.

### Lightning Network Emergence (2018-2025) [Updated 2025]

The [[Lightning Network]], a layer-2 scaling solution, began seeing real adoption from 2018 onward, enabling instant, low-fee Bitcoin payments off-chain. By 2025, the Lightning Network had grown to over 15,000 nodes and 50,000 payment channels, with total capacity exceeding 5,000 BTC. This helped offload smaller transactions from the main chain, reducing overall fee pressure especially for microtransactions.

Lightning Network adoption accelerated significantly after 2021, with major exchanges, payment processors, and even nation-states (El Salvador) implementing Lightning infrastructure. The network's ability to handle millions of transactions per second at near-zero cost provided a crucial release valve for base-layer congestion.

### Fee Market Crisis and Bull Market (2021)

In 2021, another fee market crisis occurred, with average fees again spiking above $60 during the bull market and increased on-chain activity. The April 2021 peak saw average fees reach $62, while the network experienced sustained high congestion throughout the year. This crisis reinforced the importance of scaling solutions and fee optimization techniques.

The 2021 fee spike was driven by multiple factors: renewed retail and institutional interest, DeFi activity on Bitcoin via wrapped BTC and sidechains, and increased exchange activity. Unlike 2017, however, users had more tools available, including RBF, CPFP, and Lightning Network, to manage fees effectively.

### Ordinals and BRC-20 Impact (2023-2024) [Updated 2025]

In 2023, the introduction of [[Ordinals]] (NFT-like inscriptions on Bitcoin) and [[BRC-20]] tokens (fungible tokens using the Ordinals protocol) led to a surge in on-chain activity and record-high transaction fees. These new use cases leveraged Bitcoin's scripting capabilities in novel ways, storing arbitrary data in witness data or OP_RETURN outputs.

During peak [[Runes]] adoption in Q2-Q3 2024, OP_RETURN transactions accounted for 40-60% of daily transactions, creating intense competition for block space. The April 2024 halving coincided with peak Ordinals activity, driving average fees briefly above $127 per transaction—the highest in Bitcoin's history. This period demonstrated both the flexibility of Bitcoin's protocol and the effectiveness of the fee market in allocating scarce block space to the highest-value use cases.

### Post-Halving Normalization (2024-2025) [Updated 2025]

After the 2024 halving and the peak of Ordinals/BRC-20 activity, fee pressure collapsed dramatically. Median daily fees dropped by over 80% from April 2024 to August 2025. As of late 2025, approximately 15% of daily blocks are "free blocks" with minimal or no fee pressure, and average transaction fees have returned to levels not seen since early 2023, typically ranging from $0.60 to $3.50 per transaction.

This normalization was driven by multiple factors: reduced speculative activity in Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens, increased Lightning Network adoption, widespread use of transaction batching by exchanges, and the maturation of SegWit adoption. The fee market demonstrated its characteristic boom-bust cycles, with prices discovering equilibrium after speculative frenzies.

## Technical Mechanics

### Fee Calculation and Structure

Bitcoin transaction fees are calculated independently of the amount being transferred. The fundamental formula is:

**Fee = Transaction Size (vBytes) × Fee Rate (sat/vB)**

Where:
- **vBytes** (virtual bytes) account for the SegWit discount, with witness data weighted at 25% of legacy data
- **Satoshis per vByte** (sat/vB) represents the fee rate users are willing to pay
- Total fee is the difference between input and output values in a transaction

A large-value transaction can cost less than a small-value one if its data size is smaller. This size-based pricing reflects the true cost to the network: storage and bandwidth for propagating transaction data. Typical transaction sizes range from 140 vBytes (simple SegWit send) to over 1,000 vBytes for complex multi-input/multi-output transactions.

### Mempool Mechanics

The [[mempool]] (memory pool) is a queue of unconfirmed transactions maintained by each node, waiting to be included in a block. When the mempool is congested with many pending transactions, only those with higher fees are prioritized by miners, creating a fee auction mechanism.

Key characteristics of the mempool:
- **Decentralized**: Each node maintains its own mempool, though they tend to converge
- **Dynamic**: Transactions enter when broadcast and exit when confirmed or evicted
- **Prioritized**: Miners typically order transactions by fee rate (sat/vB) to maximise revenue
- **Size-limited**: Nodes limit mempool size (default 300 MB) to prevent resource exhaustion
- **Transparent**: Users can monitor mempool size and fee distribution via explorers

During low congestion periods, transactions with even minimal fees (1 sat/vB) are typically confirmed in the next block. During high congestion, users must compete with hundreds of thousands of pending transactions, driving fee rates into hundreds of sat/vB.

### Miner Fee Selection Strategy

Miners select transactions from the mempool to maximise fee revenue per block, subject to the block size limit (4 MB weight units). The optimal strategy is to sort transactions by fee rate (sat/vB) and fill blocks starting with the highest-paying transactions. This greedy algorithm ensures miners capture maximum fee revenue.

Modern mining software implements sophisticated block template algorithms that:
- Account for [[CPFP]] (Child-Pays-For-Parent) by considering descendant fee rates
- Handle transaction dependencies and chain topology
- Optimise for total fee revenue rather than simple per-transaction sorting
- May include some low-fee transactions for non-economic reasons (testing, personal use)

The block template generation process runs continuously as new transactions arrive and existing ones are confirmed, ensuring miners always work on the most profitable block.

## Fee Estimation and Management

### Fee Estimation Algorithms

#### Bitcoin Core (History-Based Approach)

[[Bitcoin Core]] uses a history-based algorithm that groups transactions into fee rate buckets and tracks confirmation statistics:
- Transactions are grouped into **fee rate buckets** (e.g., 1-2 sat/vB, 2-3 sat/vB, etc.)
- For each bucket, the algorithm tracks how long transactions take to confirm
- An **exponential decay factor** weighs recent data more heavily than old data
- A **success threshold** (typically 95%) determines the recommended fee for a given target
- Fee estimates are provided for various confirmation targets (1 block, 3 blocks, 6 blocks, etc.)

The algorithm is implemented in `src/policy/fees.cpp` and provides conservative estimates based on historical confirmation patterns. Its main limitation is that it can lag during sudden mempool congestion spikes, as it relies primarily on past data rather than current mempool state.

#### Electrum (Hybrid Approach)

[[Electrum]] and similar wallets combine real-time mempool analysis with historical data:
- Query current mempool state from Electrum servers or full nodes
- Analyse the distribution of pending transactions and their fee rates
- Provide dynamic fee recommendations that respond quickly to changing conditions
- Offer user-adjustable urgency levels (fast, medium, slow) corresponding to different confirmation timeframes

This hybrid approach generally provides more responsive estimates during periods of rapid fee market changes, though it requires trust in server operators or running a full node.

#### Mempool-Based Estimation

Newer approaches generate block templates from the current mempool to estimate fees:
- Simulate what the next block would look like given current pending transactions
- Calculate the minimum fee rate needed for inclusion in the next N blocks
- Update estimates in real-time as transactions arrive and are confirmed
- Provide accurate estimates even during rapid mempool changes

This approach is implemented in some modern wallets and fee estimation services, providing the most responsive estimates at the cost of greater computational overhead.

#### Machine Learning Approaches

Research has explored using machine learning models for fee estimation, incorporating features such as:
- Transaction size and structure
- Current mempool state (size, fee distribution)
- Recent block intervals and mining rate
- Historical fee patterns and seasonality
- Network hash rate and difficulty

The FENN (Fee Estimation Neural Network) framework demonstrated improved accuracy over traditional analytical models in some scenarios, though practical adoption remains limited due to complexity and the effectiveness of simpler approaches.

### Replace-By-Fee (RBF)

[[Replace-By-Fee]] (RBF) allows users to resend an unconfirmed transaction with a higher fee, replacing the original in the mempool. This mechanism provides flexibility when:
- A transaction is stuck due to insufficient fees
- Network congestion suddenly increases after sending a transaction
- Users need to accelerate confirmation urgency

RBF requires:
- The original transaction must signal RBF support (BIP 125) by having at least one input with nSequence < 0xfffffffe
- The replacement must pay a higher absolute fee (not just fee rate)
- The replacement must pay for its own bandwidth (higher fee by at least 1 sat/vB × size)
- All inputs from the original transaction must be included

Not all wallets and exchanges support RBF, but it has become increasingly standard in modern Bitcoin implementations. Some services intentionally disable RBF for security or business policy reasons.

### Child-Pays-For-Parent (CPFP)

[[Child-Pays-For-Parent]] (CPFP) enables a recipient to accelerate confirmation of an incoming payment by creating a child transaction that spends the low-fee parent's output with a high fee. Miners evaluate transaction chains by their combined fee rate:

**Combined Fee Rate = (Parent Fee + Child Fee) / (Parent Size + Child Size)**

CPFP is particularly useful when:
- The sender doesn't support RBF or didn't signal it
- The recipient needs the funds urgently and can afford to pay for acceleration
- Multiple related transactions need to be confirmed together

Modern mining software automatically identifies CPFP opportunities and includes profitable transaction chains in blocks. This ensures that high-fee descendants pull in their low-fee ancestors.

## Current Fee Market State (2024-2025) [Updated 2025]

### Fee Rate Statistics

As of late 2025, Bitcoin transaction fees have normalised following the 2024 halving and Ordinals boom:

- **Average fee**: $0.60 to $3.50 per transaction
- **Median fee**: Often below $1.00 per transaction
- **Typical fee rates**: 1-10 sat/vB for standard confirmation
- **Express fee rates**: 20-50 sat/vB during mild congestion
- **Free blocks**: Approximately 15% of blocks have minimal fee pressure
- **Mempool size**: Typically 5-50 MB, occasionally spiking to 200+ MB

These low fees represent a significant improvement over the fee market crisis periods of 2017, 2021, and early 2024. Users can now transact on-chain affordably for most use cases, while Lightning Network provides near-zero-cost alternatives for smaller payments.

### Post-Halving Dynamics

The April 2024 halving reduced the block subsidy from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, making fees a larger percentage of miner revenue. Key observations:

- **Fee share of miner revenue**: Typically 5-15% (up from 2-5% pre-halving)
- **Fee volatility**: Remains high, with occasional spikes during events or new protocol features
- **Block space utilization**: Generally 90-100% during normal operations
- **Miner behaviour**: Increased optimization of transaction selection algorithms

The halving demonstrated Bitcoin's long-term sustainability model, where fee revenue gradually replaces subsidy revenue. While current fees are low in absolute terms, they represent a larger share of miner income than in previous eras.

### Layer-2 Impact

The growth of [[Lightning Network]] and other layer-2 solutions has had measurable impact on base-layer fee pressure:

- **Transaction type shift**: On-chain transactions increasingly represent high-value settlements and channel operations rather than everyday payments
- **Fee sensitivity**: Users have alternatives for low-value transactions, reducing demand during high-fee periods
- **Channel management**: Lightning channel opens/closes create predictable demand for block space
- **Batching incentives**: Layer-2 providers batch operations to minimise on-chain footprint

This multi-layer ecosystem allows Bitcoin to scale while maintaining base-layer security and decentralization. Users self-select into appropriate layers based on transaction value, urgency, and privacy requirements.

## Optimization Techniques

### Transaction Batching

Transaction batching combines multiple payments into a single on-chain transaction, dramatically reducing per-payment costs. A batched transaction with N outputs costs approximately:

**Cost per payment ≈ (140 vBytes + 35 vBytes × N) / N**

For large N, this approaches 35 vBytes per payment versus 140 vBytes for individual transactions—a 75% reduction. Major exchanges and payment processors routinely batch hundreds or thousands of payments, saving millions of dollars annually in fees.

### UTXO Consolidation

Users can consolidate multiple small [[UTXO]]s (Unspent Transaction Outputs) during low-fee periods to reduce future transaction costs. A transaction spending many UTXOs is larger and more expensive, so consolidating them when fees are low (1-2 sat/vB) prevents high costs later.

Optimal UTXO management strategies:
- **Consolidate during free blocks**: When mempool is empty, 1 sat/vB transactions confirm quickly
- **Target 1-5 UTXOs**: Minimises future transaction sizes while maintaining flexibility
- **Avoid dust UTXOs**: Very small UTXOs (< 546 sats) may cost more to spend than they're worth
- **Consider privacy**: Consolidation can reduce privacy by linking UTXOs; balance cost vs. privacy

### SegWit Address Adoption

Using native [[SegWit]] addresses (bech32 format starting with "bc1") reduces transaction size by:
- **10-15% for P2WPKH**: Single-signature transactions
- **30-40% for P2WSH**: Multi-signature and complex scripts

The witness discount means signature data is weighted at only 25% of legacy data, providing substantial fee savings. By 2025, over 85% of transactions use SegWit addresses, making it the de facto standard.

### Timing Optimization

Transaction timing can significantly impact costs:
- **Weekend transactions**: Fees typically drop on weekends when business activity is lower
- **Off-peak hours**: Late night (UTC) often sees reduced congestion
- **Avoid events**: Halving events, major protocol upgrades, or market volatility drive fee spikes
- **Monitor mempool**: Wait for mempool to clear before sending non-urgent transactions

Fee-conscious users can save 50-90% by timing transactions during low-congestion periods versus peak times.

- **Fee vs. amount independence**: Transaction value doesn't determine cost
- **Confirmation time trade-offs**: Lower fees mean longer confirmation times
- **Layer-2 alternatives**: Lightning Network for small or frequent payments
- **Timing strategies**: Weekend and off-peak transactions are cheaper

## Future Directions and Open Questions

### Long-Term Fee Market Sustainability

As block subsidies continue to halve every four years, transaction fees must eventually provide sufficient security budget for the network. Key questions:
- **Will fee revenue scale**: Can fees reach 50-100+ BTC per block as subsidies decrease?
- **Security budget adequacy**: What minimum fee level is needed to maintain 51% attack resistance?
- **Layer-2 impact**: Will Lightning reduce on-chain demand enough to threaten fee revenue?
- **Tail emission debate**: Should Bitcoin implement perpetual low-level inflation to supplement fees?

### Protocol Improvements

Ongoing research and development efforts:
- **Fee market smoothing**: Mechanisms to reduce fee volatility (e.g., elastic block sizes)
- **Better fee estimation**: More accurate algorithms using mempool state and machine learning
- **Miner-user interfaces**: Direct fee negotiation or out-of-band payment channels
- **Fee sponsorship**: Third parties paying fees on behalf of others (BIP proposal)

- **Optimal layer selection**: Decision frameworks for choosing between on-chain and off-chain
- **Submarine swaps and atomic swaps**: Mechanisms for moving value between layers
- **Drivechains and sidechains**: Alternative approaches to scaling and their fee market implications

### Regulatory and Policy Considerations
