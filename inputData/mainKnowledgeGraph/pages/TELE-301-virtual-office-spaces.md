## Definition

**Virtual Office Spaces** are persistent 3D environments in platforms like [[TELE-028-horizon-workrooms]], [[TELE-026-microsoft-mesh]], [[TELE-027-spatial-platform]] where remote teams have dedicated "virtual offices" accessible via VR headsets [[TELE-020-virtual-reality-telepresence]]. Unlike temporary meeting rooms, these spaces persist across sessions: whiteboards retain content, desks have assigned avatars, and team members "walk" through virtual hallways to join spontaneous conversations.

## Features

- **Persistent Configuration**: Office layout, furniture, decorations remain between sessions
- **Hot-Desking**: Team members claim virtual desks, personalise avatars
- **Spatial Audio**: Conversations audible based on avatar proximity (realistic office acoustics)
- **Shared Artefacts**: Whiteboards [[TELE-302-shared-whiteboards]], 3D models, documents persist
- **Meeting Rooms**: Dedicated conference spaces for scheduled/impromptu meetings

## Use Cases

- **Hybrid Work**: Remote employees "attend" virtual office daily
- **Global Teams**: Timezone-distributed teams overlap in virtual office hours
- **Onboarding**: New hires tour virtual HQ, meet colleagues as avatars
- **Social Interaction**: Watercooler conversations, casual cheque-ins

## Examples

- **PwC UK**: 1,200-person virtual office in Horizon Workrooms
- **Accenture**: "Nth Floor" metaverse office (100,000+ employees)
- **Spatial**: Creator-focused virtual workspaces with NFT galleries
