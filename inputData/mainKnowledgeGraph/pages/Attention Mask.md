## Attention Mask

Attention Mask refers to a mechanism that controls which positions in a sequence can attend to which other positions, typically implemented by adding large negative values before softmax to effectively zero out unwanted attention weights.

- Attention masking is widely adopted in natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and multimodal AI systems.
  - Industry leaders such as OpenAI, DeepMind, and Google employ masked attention in large language models (LLMs) and vision transformers to improve model interpretability, efficiency, and robustness.
  - Masked attention mechanisms support causal language modelling, padding token exclusion, and custom domain-specific masking.
- In the UK, technology hubs in London and North England cities like Manchester and Leeds are actively developing transformer-based models utilising attention masks for applications ranging from automated legal document analysis to medical imaging.
- Technical capabilities include:
  - Dynamic sparse masking to reduce computational overhead.
  - Structured masking for enforcing hierarchical or spatial constraints.
  - Learnable masks that adapt during training for task-specific optimisation.
- Limitations remain in scaling masks efficiently for very long sequences and in interpretability of complex masking strategies.
- Standards and frameworks:
  - Attention masking is supported natively in popular deep learning libraries such as PyTorch and TensorFlow.
  - Emerging frameworks focus on standardising mask formats and interoperability across modalities.
