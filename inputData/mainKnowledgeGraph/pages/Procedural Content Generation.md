## Academic Context

- Procedural Content Generation (PCG) refers to the algorithmic creation of game assets such as 3D objects, textures, environments, or entire scenes, utilising computational rules, mathematical functions, or AI models instead of manual design.
  - The academic foundation of PCG lies in computer graphics, artificial intelligence, and game design, with early roots in procedural methods used in tabletop role-playing games for dungeon and terrain generation.
  - Key developments include the integration of machine learning techniques, such as Markov chains and reinforcement learning, to enhance content quality, playability, and adaptability.
  - PCG reduces development time and costs, optimises storage requirements, and increases content variability and replayability.

## Current Landscape (2025)

- PCG is widely adopted across the gaming industry, from indie developers to major studios, for generating levels, textures, and narratives.
  - Notable platforms and tools include Houdini for 3D procedural modelling and Substance Designer for texture creation.
  - Machine learning-enhanced PCG (PCGML) is increasingly used to generate content that adapts to player behaviour, ensuring balanced difficulty and engagement.
- Technical capabilities now allow real-time content generation with player-centric adjustments, though challenges remain in ensuring coherence and narrative depth.
- Standards and frameworks are evolving to support interoperability and quality assurance in PCG, with academic and industry collaborations fostering best practices.
