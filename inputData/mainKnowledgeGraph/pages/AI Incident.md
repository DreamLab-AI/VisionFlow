  - **Definition**
    - definition:: AI Incident refers to an event, occurrence, or sequence of events involving the operation, deployment, or use of an artificial intelligence system that causes or has the potential to cause harm, damage, adverse effects, or violations of rights affecting individuals, groups, organizations, property, the environment, or fundamental human rights, encompassing technical malfunctions (performance failures, system crashes, erroneous outputs), security breaches (adversarial attacks, data poisoning, unauthorized access), ethical violations (discriminatory outcomes, bias-driven decisions affecting protected groups), privacy violations (unauthorized data disclosure, training data leakage, membership inference attacks), safety failures (physical harm from autonomous systems, critical infrastructure failures), and unintended consequences requiring investigation, root cause analysis, remediation, stakeholder notification, regulatory reporting, and implementation of corrective measures to prevent recurrence and improve system safety and trustworthiness. This comprehensive definition encompasses incident severity ranging from near-misses and minor errors to catastrophic failures with widespread impact, incident types including technical incidents (model performance degradation, robustness failures), operational incidents (deployment errors, integration failures), security incidents (cyberattacks targeting AI systems), ethical incidents (fairness violations, discriminatory outcomes), legal incidents (regulatory non-compliance, liability triggers), and reputational incidents (public backlash, stakeholder concerns). Incident characteristics include causation mechanisms (root causes spanning data quality issues, algorithmic flaws, adversarial manipulation, operational errors, design deficiencies), affected stakeholders (end users, data subjects, organizations, communities, society), impact dimensions (physical harm, economic loss, psychological distress, rights violations, environmental damage), detectability (observable failures vs latent issues requiring investigation), and reversibility (ability to remediate consequences). Incident management requires structured processes for detection and identification, severity assessment and triage, immediate containment and mitigation, stakeholder notification including affected parties and regulators, root cause investigation, remediation and corrective action implementation, documentation and reporting per EU AI Act Article 73 requirements for high-risk systems, and knowledge sharing via AI incident databases (AI Incident Database, OECD AI Incidents Monitor) enabling sector-wide learning and prevention, formalized through emerging standards including IEEE P2863 on AI incident reporting.

## Academic Context

- AI incidents refer to events involving artificial intelligence systems that cause or have the potential to cause harm to individuals, property, the environment, or fundamental rights.
  - These incidents encompass malfunctions, security breaches, bias-driven discrimination, privacy violations, and unintended consequences that require investigation and remediation.
  - The academic foundation for defining AI incidents draws from interdisciplinary fields including computer science, ethics, law, and risk management, emphasising the need for clear taxonomy and reporting standards to improve safety and accountability.
  - Key developments include frameworks for incident classification and reporting inspired by established sectors such as aviation and cybersecurity, aiming to systematise data collection and response protocols[1][2][5].

## Current Landscape (2025)

- Industry adoption of AI has expanded rapidly, integrating into critical sectors such as healthcare, finance, transport, and energy, increasing the scale and impact of AI incidents.
  - Notable organisations maintaining AI incident databases include the AI Incident Database and the MIT AI Risk Database, which collectively document thousands of incidents worldwide, highlighting an accelerating trend in AI-related harms[3][4].
  - In the UK, leading technology firms and research institutions actively contribute to AI safety research and incident reporting initiatives.
  - Technical capabilities of AI systems have advanced, but limitations remain, particularly regarding model hallucinations, bias, and verification challenges, which contribute to the so-called “verification tax” where human oversight is necessary to validate AI outputs[3].
  - Standards and frameworks for AI incident reporting are evolving, with proposals for mandatory reporting regimes that include detailed incident components such as type, severity, affected entities, and context to enhance transparency and regulatory oversight[2].

## UK Context

- The UK has been proactive in AI governance, with government-backed initiatives promoting responsible AI development and incident management.
  - North England, including innovation hubs in Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield, hosts several AI research centres and startups focusing on AI safety and ethical AI applications.
  - Regional case studies include collaborative projects between universities and industry partners to develop AI incident monitoring tools tailored to healthcare and public infrastructure sectors, reflecting the UK's commitment to balancing innovation with public safety[7].
  - The UK's regulatory landscape is evolving to incorporate AI incident reporting requirements aligned with international standards, fostering interoperability and accountability.

## Future Directions

- Emerging trends include the integration of AI incident reporting into broader risk management systems and the use of AI itself to predict and prevent incidents.
  - Anticipated challenges involve managing the complexity of AI systems, ensuring timely and accurate incident reporting, and addressing ethical concerns related to bias and privacy.
  - Research priorities emphasise developing robust frameworks for incident classification, enhancing transparency, and fostering international cooperation to manage AI risks effectively.
