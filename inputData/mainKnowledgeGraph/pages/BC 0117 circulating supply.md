- ## About BC 0117 Circulating Supply

	- ### Primary Definition
		- **Circulating supply** refers to the number of [[cryptocurrency]] [[tokens]] or [[coins]] that are publicly available and actively circulating in the market at a given time. [Updated 2025]
		- This metric excludes:
			- [[Locked tokens]] held in smart contracts or escrow
			- [[Reserved tokens]] allocated for team, advisors, or foundation
			- [[Burned tokens]] permanently removed from circulation
			- Tokens subject to [[vesting schedules]] or time-locks
			- Tokens held in treasury or strategic reserves
		- Circulating supply is fundamental for calculating [[market capitalization]] (circulating supply × current price) and assessing [[token liquidity]].

	- ### Technical Definition
		- A formally-defined economic metric in [[blockchain]] systems that quantifies the [[liquid supply]] of digital assets available for trading, transfers, and economic activity at a specific point in time.
		- Circulating supply is determined through [[on-chain analysis]], smart contract queries, and transparent reporting by token issuers.
		- Accurate circulating supply data requires:
			- Real-time blockchain state analysis
			- Smart contract audit of locked/vesting tokens
			- Transparent disclosure from project teams
			- Standardized calculation methodologies

	- ### Standards-Based Definition
		- According to **ISO/IEC 23257:2021** (Blockchain and distributed ledger technologies — Reference architecture), circulating supply represents a fundamental economic parameter of tokenized systems that must be transparently calculated and reported for market integrity. This international standard provides guidelines for blockchain reference architecture, including token lifecycle management, supply mechanics, and economic parameter disclosure. It emphasises the importance of accurately distinguishing between total supply, maximum supply, and circulating supply to prevent market manipulation and ensure investor protection. [Updated 2025] [Source: ISO/IEC 23257:2021]
		- **NIST NISTIR 8202** (Blockchain Technology Overview) addresses token supply metrics as critical components of blockchain transparency and accountability. This technical report from the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology provides comprehensive guidance on blockchain technology fundamentals, including tokenomics, supply chain integrity, and circulating supply verification methods. NIST emphasises that circulating supply calculations must account for locked tokens, staking mechanisms, and programmatic release schedules to provide accurate market data. The report highlights the role of circulating supply in price discovery, market efficiency, and investor decision-making. [Updated 2025] [Source: NIST NISTIR 8202]

- ## Academic Context

	- The concept of **circulating supply** in [[cryptocurrency]] economics derives from traditional monetary theory concepts of [[money supply]] (M1, M2, M3) adapted to digital assets. [Updated 2025]
	- [[Academic foundations]] of circulating supply metrics:
		- **[[Monetary economics]]**: Classical money supply theory applied to digital tokens

- ## Mathematical Foundations

	- ### Core Formulas
		- **Circulating Supply Calculation**:
			```
			Circulating Supply = Total Minted - (Locked + Burned + Reserved + Unvested)
			```
		- **Market Capitalization**:
			```
			Market Cap = Circulating Supply × Current Price
			```
		- **Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV)**:
			```
			FDV = Maximum Supply × Current Price
			```		- **Circulating Supply Ratio**:
			```
			Circulating Ratio = Circulating Supply / Maximum Supply × 100%
			```
