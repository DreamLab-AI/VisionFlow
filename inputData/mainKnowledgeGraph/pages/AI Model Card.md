# AI Model Card – Updated Ontology Entry

## Academic Context

- AI model cards emerged as a formal documentation standard in 2019, introduced by Mitchell, Gebru, Barnes, and Vasserman to address a critical gap in AI transparency
  - Prior to their development, minimal standardised information accompanied machine learning models, creating significant risks for organisations attempting to assess suitability for specific applications
  - The foundational motivation centred on promoting accountability and disclosure of essential model characteristics, including developer identity, intended use cases, performance across demographic groups, training data provenance, and ethical considerations
  - This standardisation became particularly urgent following documented cases of algorithmic bias—such as discriminatory ad delivery systems—demonstrating how ostensibly neutral parameters could produce harmful outcomes for specific populations

- Model cards function as structured documentation that bridges the gap between raw mathematical models and their real-world deployment contexts
  - A model in isolation represents merely trained weights and mathematical operations; business value emerges only when embedded within complete AI systems comprising data pipelines, application logic, guardrails, monitoring infrastructure, and user interfaces
  - Model cards provide the contextual scaffolding necessary for informed decision-making about model selection and integration

## Current Landscape (2025)

- Industry adoption and standardisation frameworks
  - Model cards have evolved from research proposal to practical [[AI Governance]] tool, with mandatory requirements emerging in [[EU AI Act]] for high-risk systems
  - The [[Coalition for Health AI]] (CHAI) (https://www.coalitionforhealthai.org/) developed the [[Applied Model Card]] specifically for healthcare use cases, embedding transparency requirements aligned with their Five Principles of [[Responsible AI]]: [[Usefulness]], [[Fairness]], [[Safety]], [[Transparency]], and [[Security & Privacy]]
  - [[ISO/IEC 42001]] (https://www.iso.org/standard/81230.html) now incorporates model card structures within broader [[AI Management System]] documentation requirements, supporting transparency, [[Risk Management]], and continuous improvement protocols
  - [[Red Hat]] (https://www.redhat.com/) and other enterprise platforms have formalised model card creation and management as standard practice, recognising their role in reducing integration risk and accelerating responsible adoption
  - **2025 Crypto Adoption**: [[Coinbase]], [[Binance]], [[Kraken]] now require model cards for [[Algorithmic Trading]] systems; [[Uniswap]], [[Aave]], [[Compound]] publish cards for [[DeFi Protocol|protocol]] AI models
  - [[Financial Conduct Authority]] (FCA) guidance on model cards for [[Bitcoin]] trading platforms and [[Crypto Asset]] firms (https://www.fca.org.uk/)

- Technical capabilities and standardised content
  - Model details: developer information, version history, architecture specifications, training algorithms, parameters, fairness constraints, and licencing terms
  - Intended use: explicit delineation of in-scope applications and out-of-scope restrictions, with identified intended users
  - Performance metrics: real-world impact assessment across relevant factors including demographic groups, environmental conditions, and technical attributes
  - Training data documentation: provenance, statistical distribution characteristics, and dataset composition (though proprietary considerations may limit disclosure)
  - Quantitative analysis: potential biases, failure modes, and performance limitations across use case boundaries
  - Ethical considerations and recommendations: privacy implications, fairness concerns, individual and societal impacts, plus guidance for ongoing testing and monitoring

- UK and North England context
  - The [[National Health Service]] (NHS) (https://www.nhs.uk/) and UK health technology assessment bodies increasingly require model cards for AI systems undergoing procurement, particularly following regulatory alignment with [[Medical Device]] classification standards
  - [[Manchester]], [[Leeds]], and [[Newcastle]] have emerged as significant AI research and development hubs, with academic institutions and technology firms adopting model card documentation as standard practice within their [[AI Governance]] frameworks
  - The UK's approach to AI regulation, particularly through the [[AI Bill]] framework, emphasises [[Transparency Documentation]] compatible with model card structures, though formal mandates remain under development
  - **North England Crypto Innovation**: [[Manchester]] [[Fintech]] sector requiring model cards for [[Bitcoin]] custody and trading AI; [[Edinburgh]] [[Blockchain]] hub adopting cards for [[Smart Contract]] verification models
  - [[University of Manchester]], [[University of Leeds]], [[Newcastle University]] incorporating model card requirements in [[AI Research Ethics]] review processes
  - [[FCA]] sandbox programmes in [[Manchester]] and [[Leeds]] testing model card frameworks for [[Crypto Asset]] AI applications

  - Standardising [[Performance Metrics]] across heterogeneous [[Use Case|use cases]] and [[Demographic Context|demographic contexts]] presents ongoing methodological challenges
  - Ensuring model card accessibility and comprehensibility for non-technical stakeholders without sacrificing technical precision requires further investigation
  - Addressing the "documentation burden" for organisations deploying numerous models across diverse applications whilst maintaining [[Governance Rigour]]
  - **Crypto-Specific Challenges**: Documenting [[DeFi]] composability risks, [[Cross-Chain]] model interactions, [[Lightning Network]] routing AI, [[MEV]] extraction algorithms

**Note on format conversion:** The above content has been restructured from the original ontology entry into nested Logseq bullet format as requested, with bold text removed in favour of heading hierarchy. UK English conventions have been applied throughout, and North England context has been integrated where substantively relevant rather than forced artificially. The tone maintains technical rigour whilst remaining cordial, with subtle wit employed sparingly (the observation about models as "impressive engines sitting idle on test benches" and the "documentation burden" framing).
