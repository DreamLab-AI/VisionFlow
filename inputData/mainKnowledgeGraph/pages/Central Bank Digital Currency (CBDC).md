- ## About Central Bank Digital Currencies
  id:: cbdc-about
	- Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are **state-issued digital currencies** that function as electronic forms of a nation's fiat currency, backed by the full faith and credit of the issuing government. Unlike cryptocurrencies or stablecoins, CBDCs are sovereign money issued and regulated by central banks, designed to coexist with or potentially replace physical cash while maintaining central bank control over monetary policy. CBDCs represent the digital evolution of traditional money in response to declining cash usage, rising cryptocurrency adoption, and the need for efficient cross-border payments.
	- CBDCs exist in two primary forms: retail CBDCs for public use in everyday transactions, and wholesale CBDCs for interbank settlement and financial institution operations. Retail CBDCs enable individuals and businesses to hold digital currency directly with the central bank or through intermediaries like commercial banks, offering financial inclusion benefits for unbanked populations. Wholesale CBDCs streamline settlement processes between financial institutions, reducing counterparty risk and enabling real-time gross settlement systems.
	- The design of CBDC systems involves fundamental choices about architecture (centralised vs. decentralized ledgers), access models (account-based vs. token-based), anonymity levels (ranging from full privacy to complete transparency), and technical infrastructure (distributed ledger technology, traditional databases, or hybrid systems). These decisions reflect national priorities balancing privacy, security, monetary sovereignty, financial stability, and regulatory compliance. As of 2024, over 130 countries representing 98% of global GDP are exploring CBDCs, with active pilots in China (digital yuan), European Union (digital euro), and numerous other jurisdictions.

## Academic Context

- Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) represents a **digital form of central bank money**, issued and backed by a sovereign monetary authority, designed to function as legal tender in digital form.
  - CBDCs are conceptualised as digital liabilities of central banks, analogous to physical banknotes but existing solely in electronic form.
  - The academic foundation draws from monetary theory, digital payment systems, and distributed ledger technology (DLT), with ongoing debates on implications for monetary policy, financial stability, and privacy.
  - Key developments include distinctions between **retail CBDCs** (for general public use) and **wholesale CBDCs** (restricted to financial institutions), with varying technological architectures ranging from centralised ledgers to permissioned DLT systems.

## Current Landscape (2025)

- CBDCs have moved beyond theoretical exploration into pilot phases and limited rollouts globally, with over 90 countries investigating or implementing versions of CBDCs.
  - Notable platforms include China’s digital yuan, the Bahamas’ Sand Dollar, and the Eastern Caribbean’s DCash.
  - The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub continues to coordinate multi-jurisdictional research and experimentation on CBDCs, focusing on interoperability and cross-border payments.
- In the UK, the Bank of England remains cautious but actively researching CBDC feasibility, emphasising financial stability and privacy.
- Technical capabilities:
  - CBDCs enable **instant settlement**, enhanced traceability, and programmability of money.
  - Limitations include scalability challenges, cybersecurity risks, and the need to balance privacy with regulatory compliance.
- Standards and frameworks are evolving, with international bodies like the IMF and BIS providing guidance on design principles, legal frameworks, and data governance.
