## Definition

**Robotic Telepresence** systems employ mobile robotic platforms as physical avatars for remote operators, projecting human presence into real-world environments through bidirectional video/audio communication whilst enabling navigation and interaction. Unlike purely virtual telepresence ([[TELE-020-virtual-reality-telepresence]]) occurring in digital spaces, robotic telepresence embeds remote participants in physical locations — offices, hospitals, museums, homes — where they can move autonomously, maintain eye contact via pan-tilt displays, and engage with local individuals as embodied proxies.

A typical robotic telepresence platform consists of: a wheeled mobile base providing locomotion; a vertical mast terminating in a display screen showing the remote operator's video feed; cameras capturing the local environment; microphones and speakers for bidirectional audio; and networking hardware streaming media over WiFi/5G. Remote operators control the robot through web interfaces, mobile apps, or VR headsets, driving navigation via keyboard/touchscreen whilst their video appears on the robot's screen, creating the impression of physical presence for local participants.

Advanced systems incorporate autonomous navigation, collision avoidance, and AI-driven positioning to automatically centre the robot in conversations or navigate to meeting rooms. This hybrid human-AI control enables operators to focus on interaction whilst delegating mobility to autonomous systems ([[TELE-201-teleoperation-systems]]).

## Comparison to Virtual Telepresence

| Aspect | Robotic Telepresence | VR Telepresence ([[TELE-020-virtual-reality-telepresence]]) |
|--------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Environment** | Physical, real-world | Virtual, computer-generated |
| **Interaction** | Real objects, people | Virtual avatars, objects |
| **Mobility** | Robot drives through space | Teleport, walk virtually |
| **Presence Cues** | Physical embodiment | Immersive visuals, spatial audio |
| **Use Case** | Office visits, medical rounds | Design reviews, training simulations |
| **Cost** | £2,000-£15,000 hardware | £300-£3,500 VR headset |

**Hybrid Approach**: Some systems combine both (robot displays VR environment, operator controls from VR headset)

## Ethical and Social Considerations

### Privacy
- Robots equipped with cameras raise surveillance concerns
- Solutions: LED indicators when recording, privacy mode (screen off), access logs

### Accessibility
- Robots enable participation for wheelchair users, immunocompromised individuals
- Risk: Assuming robot is sufficient replacement for physical accommodations

### Labour Implications
- Remote workers via robots may be "always available", blurring work/life boundaries
- Risk: Devaluation of local presence, outsourcing skilled labour

### Social Norms
- Etiquette unclear: Can robot enter private offices? Interrupt conversations?
- Cultural acceptance varies: Higher in Japan, Scandinavia; lower in Southern Europe

## Future Directions

**Near-Term (2025-2027)**:
- Autonomous multi-floor navigation (elevators, doors)
- Manipulator arms for object handoff ([[TELE-202-remote-manipulation]])
- Emotional expression via LED faces or animated displays

**Medium-Term (2027-2030)**:
- Humanoid telepresence robots with bipedal walking
