## Logistics Optimization

Logistics Optimization refers to a component of the blockchain ecosystem.

- Industry adoption and implementations
	- Major logistics providers and manufacturers are deploying blockchain platforms to streamline global supply chains
	- Notable organisations and platforms
		- Maersk’s TradeLens (now integrated with other global platforms)
		- IBM’s Food Trust for perishable goods
		- UK-based startups such as Provenance and Everledger are active in traceability and compliance
	- UK and North England examples where relevant
		- Manchester’s logistics sector has seen increased adoption of blockchain for customs documentation and cross-border trade, particularly in the automotive and pharmaceutical industries
		- Leeds and Newcastle are emerging as hubs for digital supply chain innovation, with local universities collaborating on pilot projects
		- Sheffield’s advanced manufacturing cluster is leveraging blockchain for component traceability and regulatory reporting
- Technical capabilities and limitations
	- Capabilities
		- Real-time tracking and immutable record-keeping
		- Automated compliance and smart contract execution
		- Enhanced collaboration across multi-party supply chains
	- Limitations
		- Scalability challenges for high-volume transactions
		- Interoperability with legacy systems remains a hurdle
		- Data privacy and regulatory compliance require careful design
- Standards and frameworks
	- GS1 standards for supply chain data interoperability
	- ISO/TC 307 for blockchain and distributed ledger technologies
	- UK government-backed initiatives promoting digital trade and supply chain resilience
