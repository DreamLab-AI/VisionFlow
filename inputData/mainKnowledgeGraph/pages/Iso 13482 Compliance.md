# Updated Ontology Entry: rb-0088-iso-13482-compliance

## Academic Context

- ISO 13482:2014 establishes the foundational safety framework for personal care robots[1]
  - Developed by working group experts from 25 countries[3]
  - Specifies requirements for inherently safe design, protective measures, and user information[1]
  - Defines personal care robots as machines intended to interact with human users to provide one or more personal care services[3]
  - Personal care services encompass domestic tasks, communication, education and entertainment activities[3]
- The standard represents a shift from purely mechanical safety considerations to human-robot interaction paradigms
  - Addresses physical contact conditions between humans and robots[5]
  - Incorporates functional safety requirements specific to service robotics[5]

## Current Landscape (2025)

- Standards evolution and revision status
  - ISO 13482:2014 currently under revision (Stage 90.92)[1]
  - ISO/FDIS 13482 (Second Edition) in final approval stage as of November 2025[5]
  - Expanded scope now covers service robots in both personal and professional/commercial applications[4][5]
  - Notably excludes industrial and medical applications from current scope[5]
- Market adoption patterns
  - ISO 13482 remains widely adopted across Western markets (US, EU, Canada, Australia)[2]
  - Emerging competition from IEC 63310 standard (published January 2025), which emphasises connected systems and service delivery metrics rather than traditional safety-focused approaches[2]
  - European markets showing preference for IEC 63310 due to Active and Assisted Living (AAL) initiatives[2]
  - North American markets continuing with ISO 13482 for safety-critical applications[2]
  - Asian markets exploring IEC 63310 adoption as part of smart city and ageing population initiatives[2]
- Technical compliance requirements
  - Risk assessment and hazard analysis[2]
  - Safety function testing and validation[2]
  - Physical safety testing and certification[2]
  - Comprehensive documentation including risk assessment files and safety specifications[2]
  - User instructions and safety information provision[2]

## Standards Framework and Technical Scope

- Coverage areas under ISO 13482[3]
  - Design and construction requirements for personal care robots
  - Information and documentation supplied with personal care robots
  - Test methods for assessing compliance with safety requirements
- Comparative standards landscape
  - ISO 10218 series governs industrial robot safety (distinct from personal care focus)[6]
  - ISO/TS 15066 technical specification (now integrated into ISO 10218-2:2025) addresses collaborative robot safety with force, pressure and speed limits[6]
  - ISO 4448 provides technical guidance for public-area mobile robots[2]
- Implementation challenges for compliance
  - Safety validation requires rigorous hazard analysis and risk assessment protocols[2]
  - Documentation burden includes functional specifications and validation reports[2]
  - Testing must occur across diverse deployment environments (homes, hospitals, healthcare facilities)[3]

## UK Context

- Regulatory landscape and governance
  - Loughborough University research (2025) has called for tailored UK Government regulations specifically addressing home-based care robots, highlighting gaps in current safety and ethical frameworks[8]
  - Current UK adoption primarily follows ISO 13482:2014 framework, though emerging IEC 63310 considerations may influence future policy
- North England considerations
  - Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle and Sheffield represent significant healthcare and technology sectors where personal care robot deployment is anticipated
  - Regional NHS trusts and social care providers represent primary implementation contexts, though specific case studies remain limited in current literature
  - University research infrastructure (including Loughborough) provides testing and validation capabilities for compliance verification

## Research and Literature

- Key sources and standards documentation
  - ISO 13482:2014 – Safety requirements for personal care robots. International Organization for Standardization, 2014. Published standard, 79 pages.[1]

## Future Directions and Anticipated Developments

- Standards convergence and evolution
  - ISO 13482 Second Edition will expand beyond personal care to encompass broader service robot applications[5]
  - Potential harmonisation challenges between ISO 13482 and IEC 63310 frameworks as adoption patterns emerge[2]
  - Integration of functional safety requirements with traditional hazard-based approaches[5]
- Regulatory and policy priorities
  - UK Government development of tailored regulations for home-based care robots, addressing current governance gaps[8]
  - Regional implementation frameworks needed across North England healthcare and social care sectors
  - Clarification of ethical considerations alongside safety requirements[8]
- Technical research priorities
  - Connected system architecture validation and interoperability testing[2]
  - Service delivery metrics and key performance indicator frameworks[2]
  - Real-world performance validation across diverse home environments[2]
  - Accessibility standards for users with varying physical and cognitive capabilities[2]
