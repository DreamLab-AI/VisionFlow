	- definition:: Super-Resolution is the process of enhancing the resolution and quality of low-resolution images by predicting and synthesising high-frequency details using deep learning models. Single image super-resolution (SISR) networks (SRCNN, ESRGAN, Real-ESRGAN) reconstruct plausible high-resolution images from degraded inputs, enabling applications in medical imaging enhancement, satellite imagery analysis, and consumer photo enhancement.
