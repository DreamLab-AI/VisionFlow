## Permissionless Network

Permissionless Network refers to open access blockchain within blockchain systems, providing essential functionality for distributed ledger technology operations and properties.

- Industry adoption and implementations
	- Notable organisations and platforms
		- Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to dominate as the most widely used permissionless blockchains
		- Layer-2 solutions (e.g., Optimism, Arbitrum) have matured, improving scalability and reducing transaction costs
		- DeFi and NFT platforms built on permissionless networks are now mainstream, with significant user bases and institutional interest
	- UK and North England examples where relevant
		- UK-based fintechs and Web3 startups increasingly leverage permissionless networks for transparent, trustless services
		- In North England, cities like Manchester and Leeds host growing blockchain communities, with local universities and incubators supporting research and development
		- For example, the University of Manchester’s Distributed Systems Group explores permissionless architectures for supply chain and identity management
	- Technical capabilities and limitations
		- Permissionless networks offer high transparency and censorship resistance, but face challenges in scalability, energy efficiency, and regulatory compliance
		- Advances in consensus algorithms and Layer-2 solutions have mitigated some limitations, but trade-offs remain
	- Standards and frameworks
		- Industry standards (e.g., ERC-20, ERC-721) and open-source frameworks (e.g., Ethereum, Polkadot) facilitate interoperability and innovation
		- Regulatory frameworks in the UK are evolving, with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) providing guidance on crypto assets and decentralised finance
