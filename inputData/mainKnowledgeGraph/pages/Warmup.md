```

## Academic Context

Warmup emerged as a critical technique for training large models, particularly transformers, where high initial learning rates can cause divergence.

**Primary Source**: Transformer training practices; mentioned in Vaswani et al. and subsequent papers

## Key Characteristics

- Gradual learning rate increase
- Stabilises early training
- Prevents divergence
- Standard for transformers
- Typically 1K-10K steps
- Precedes main schedule

**Typical Implementation**:
```
For step s in [1, warmup_steps]:
  lr = max_lr × (s / warmup_steps)
```

## UK English Notes

- "Optimisation" (not "optimization")
- "Stabilises" (not "stabilizes")
