## Parameter Count

Parameter Count refers to the total number of trainable parameters in a neural network, serving as a primary measure of model size and capacity, typically ranging from millions to hundreds of billions in modern language models.

- Definition and foundational role
  - Internal variables adjusted during training to improve predictive accuracy
  - Act as the model's "tuning knobs" refined through data exposure
  - In deep learning, parameters primarily comprise weights assigned to connections between neurons
  - Serve as a primary measure of model size and computational capacity
- Historical development
  - Neural scaling laws framework established by Banko and colleagues
  - Chinchilla model introduced standardised approaches to parameter-compute relationships
  - Recent unification of sparse and dense model scaling laws (ICLR 2025)
- Relationship to model architecture
  - Model structure and neuron layer depth significantly influence total parameter count
  - Special architectural components (attention mechanisms, mixture-of-experts) contribute substantially
  - Sparse models can achieve comparable performance with lower active parameter counts than dense equivalents

## Current Landscape (2025)

- Parameter count ranges and scale
  - Modern language models typically range from millions to hundreds of billions of parameters
  - "Giant models" now routinely reach billions to trillions of parameters
  - Sparse pre-training configurations demonstrate that average parameter count predicts evaluation loss equally well across sparse and dense architectures
- Technical considerations and trade-offs
  - More parameters enable models to capture complex data patterns, potentially improving accuracy
  - Excessive parameters risk overfitting—memorising training examples rather than learning underlying patterns
  - Critical balance required between capacity and generalisation performance
  - Sparse architectures offer computational efficiency without proportional performance sacrifice
- Industry adoption
  - Parameter count remains a widely cited metric for model capability comparison
  - Increasingly supplemented by compute-aware metrics (training compute, dataset size)
  - Mixture-of-experts models complicate direct parameter-to-capability comparisons
- Standards and frameworks
  - Unified scaling laws now accommodate both sparse and dense pre-training regimes
  - Average parameter count metric provides consistent predictive framework across model types
  - Downstream task evaluation validates sparse-dense equivalence beyond loss metrics
