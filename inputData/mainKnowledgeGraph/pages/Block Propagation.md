## Block Propagation

Block Propagation refers to network block distribution within blockchain systems, providing essential functionality for distributed ledger technology operations and properties.

- Industry adoption and implementations
	- Block propagation is a core feature of all major blockchain platforms, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana
	- Notable organisations and platforms
		- Bitcoin and Ethereum networks continue to refine their propagation protocols, with Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake influencing validator selection and block distribution
		- Solana’s Turbine protocol exemplifies advanced block propagation, using a layered network structure to minimise latency and maximise throughput
- UK and North England examples where relevant
	- UK-based fintech firms and blockchain startups, such as those in Manchester and Leeds, leverage efficient block propagation for payment rails and smart contract platforms
	- Newcastle and Sheffield universities host research groups exploring blockchain scalability and propagation optimisation, contributing to both academic and industrial advancements
- Technical capabilities and limitations
	- Propagation speed is typically measured in seconds, with median times for Bitcoin around 6.5 seconds and mean times around 12.6 seconds, though delays can occur due to network conditions and block size
	- Limitations include the risk of forks if propagation is too slow, leading to orphaned blocks and wasted mining effort
- Standards and frameworks
	- Industry standards focus on interoperability and security, with frameworks such as the Blockchain Interoperability Alliance promoting best practices for block propagation and network communication
