## Blockchain Interoperability

Blockchain Interoperability refers to a component of the blockchain ecosystem.

- Industry adoption and implementations
  - Major blockchain platforms such as Polkadot, Cosmos, and Chainlink have established interoperability as a core feature
  - Enterprises are increasingly adopting cross-chain solutions to streamline operations and reduce reliance on centralised intermediaries
  - In the UK, financial institutions and fintech companies are exploring interoperable blockchain systems for payments, settlements, and asset management
- Notable organisations and platforms
  - Polkadot: Facilitates cross-chain communication through its relay chain architecture
  - Cosmos: Employs the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol for secure data and asset transfers
  - Chainlink: Offers Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) for token transfers and smart contract interactions
- UK and North England examples where relevant
  - Manchester-based fintech startups are piloting interoperable blockchain solutions for supply chain finance
  - Leeds and Newcastle universities are collaborating on research projects focused on cross-chain smart contracts and decentralised identity
  - Sheffield’s Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre is exploring interoperable blockchain systems for industrial applications
- Technical capabilities and limitations
  - Current solutions enable secure cross-chain asset transfers, data exchange, and smart contract interoperability
  - Challenges remain in terms of scalability, security, and standardisation across diverse blockchain networks
- Standards and frameworks
  - The Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol is widely adopted for secure cross-chain messaging
  - The Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) provides a standardised approach to token transfers and smart contract interactions
  - Ongoing efforts to develop universal standards for interoperability, such as the Blockchain Interoperability Alliance
