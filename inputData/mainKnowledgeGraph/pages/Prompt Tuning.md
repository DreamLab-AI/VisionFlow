## Prompt Tuning

Prompt Tuning refers to a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that learns continuous prompt embeddings prepended to the input whilst keeping the pre-trained model frozen. prompt tuning optimises task-specific soft prompts in the embedding space rather than modifying model weights.

- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique for adapting pre-trained language models to downstream tasks[1][2][3]
  - Learns small set of trainable soft prompt embeddings (continuous vectors) prepended or appended to input sequences[1][3]
  - Maintains frozen backbone model weights, reducing computational overhead substantially[2]
  - Emerged as practical alternative to full model fine-tuning, particularly valuable for resource-constrained environments[1]
  - Inspired by soft prompting methodology, representing evolution in model adaptation strategies[1]

## Current Landscape (2025)

- Industry adoption and implementations
  - Widely adopted across natural language processing, vision transformer applications, and multimodal systems[2]
  - Enables creation of multiple task-specific "prompt modules" from single pre-trained model without full model replication[4]
  - Reduces trainable parameters to as little as 0.1% of original footprint, slashing compute requirements by up to 90%[6]
  - Benchmark studies demonstrate prompt-tuned models retain over 92% performance of fully fine-tuned counterparts across translation, summarisation, and reasoning tasks[6]
  - Complements other adaptation strategies including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)[2]
- Technical capabilities and limitations
  - Core mechanism: gradient-based optimisation of soft prompt parameters whilst backbone remains frozen[2]
  - Requires task-specific labelled dataset for supervised optimisation[2]
  - Mitigates catastrophic forgetting—where models lose previously learned information when trained on new tasks[4]
  - Trade-offs include potential domain drift and oversight challenges in certain applications[6]
  - Success often dependent on model size; larger models generally yield better results[2]
- Standards and frameworks
  - Classified as Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) technique within broader AI adaptation taxonomy[2][4]
  - Increasingly integrated into foundation model customisation workflows across industry[2]
