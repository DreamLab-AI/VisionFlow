- ## Overview

- A [[Variational Autoencoder]] (VAE) is a type of [[Generative Model]] that combines the concepts of [[Autoencoder|autoencoders]] and [[Variational Inference]] to create a powerful framework for [[Unsupervised Learning]], [[Representation Learning]], and [[Data Generation]]

- VAEs extend the traditional [[Autoencoder]] framework by incorporating [[Probabilistic Modelling]] into the [[Latent Space]], enabling them to learn [[Probability Distribution|probability distributions]] over data rather than deterministic mappings

- First introduced by Kingma and Welling (2013) and independently by Rezende, Mohamed, and Wierstra (2014), VAEs have become foundational in [[Deep Generative Models]] alongside [[Generative Adversarial Networks]] and [[Diffusion Models]]

- The key innovation of VAEs lies in their ability to learn a continuous, structured [[Latent Representation]] that can be sampled from to generate new data, making them invaluable for tasks ranging from [[Image Generation]] to [[Drug Discovery]] and [[Anomaly Detection]]

- ## Mathematical Foundations

- ### Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO)

- The VAE training objective is derived from maximising the [[Evidence Lower Bound]] (ELBO), which provides a tractable lower bound on the [[Log-Likelihood]] of the data

- For observed data **x** and latent variables **z**, we want to maximise the log marginal likelihood: log p(x) = log ∫ p(x|z)p(z)dz

- This integral is typically intractable, so VAEs introduce an approximate posterior q(z|x) (the [[Encoder]]) to approximate the true posterior p(z|x)

- The ELBO is derived using [[Jensen's Inequality]]: log p(x) ≥ 𝔼_{q(z|x)}[log p(x|z)] - KL(q(z|x)||p(z))

- This decomposes into two terms: the **reconstruction loss** (expected log-likelihood) and the **KL regularization** term that keeps the posterior close to the prior

- The ELBO can also be written as: ELBO = log p(x) - KL(q(z|x)||p(z|x))

- This formulation shows that maximising the ELBO is equivalent to minimising the [[KL Divergence]] between the approximate and true posterior while maximising the data likelihood

- ### KL Divergence and Regularization

- The [[Kullback-Leibler Divergence]] term KL(q(z|x)||p(z)) acts as a [[Regularization]] mechanism that prevents the [[Encoder Network]] from learning arbitrary distributions

- For a [[Gaussian Distribution]] prior p(z) = 𝒩(0, I) and Gaussian posterior q(z|x) = 𝒩(μ, σ²I), the KL divergence has a closed form:

- KL(q||p) = ½ Σ(σ² + μ² - log(σ²) - 1)

- This regularization encourages the learned latent distribution to be close to a standard [[Normal Distribution]], ensuring the latent space has good properties for generation

- Without this term, the model would collapse to a deterministic [[Autoencoder]], losing its generative capabilities

- The KL term also prevents "holes" in the latent space, ensuring that sampling from any region of the prior produces meaningful outputs

- ### Reparameterization Trick

- The [[Reparameterization Trick]] is a crucial innovation that enables [[Backpropagation]] through the stochastic sampling operation in VAEs

- Direct sampling z ~ q(z|x) = 𝒩(μ, σ²) is not differentiable, preventing [[Gradient Descent]] optimization

- The trick reparameterizes the sampling as: z = μ + σ ⊙ ε, where ε ~ 𝒩(0, I)

- This separates the stochasticity (ε) from the parameters (μ, σ), allowing gradients to flow through μ and σ

- The reparameterization enables [[Monte Carlo Estimation]] of the ELBO gradient: ∇_{θ,φ} ELBO ≈ ∇_{θ,φ} [log p_θ(x|z) - KL(q_φ(z|x)||p(z))]

- This technique is fundamental to training VAEs and has been extended to other distributions beyond Gaussians using methods like [[Gumbel-Softmax]]

- [Updated 2025] Modern implementations use automatic differentiation frameworks that handle reparameterization implicitly

- ### Loss Function Components

- The complete VAE loss function combines reconstruction and regularization: ℒ_VAE = -𝔼_{q(z|x)}[log p(x|z)] + β·KL(q(z|x)||p(z))

- **Reconstruction Loss**: Measures how well the [[Decoder]] can reconstruct input from latent code

- For continuous data: typically [[Mean Squared Error]] (MSE) or L2 loss

- For binary data: [[Binary Cross-Entropy]] loss

- For image data: often perceptual losses using [[VGG Network]] features or [[LPIPS]]

- **KL Regularization**: Prevents [[Posterior Collapse]] and ensures structured latent space

- The β parameter (from [[Beta-VAE]]) controls the trade-off between reconstruction quality and latent regularization

- Higher β values enforce stronger disentanglement but may reduce reconstruction quality

- ### Variational Inference Framework

- VAEs are an application of [[Variational Inference]] to learn deep generative models with continuous latent variables

- The [[Mean-Field Approximation]] assumes factorization: q(z|x) = Π_i q(z_i|x), though VAEs often use full covariance Gaussians

- [[Amortized Inference]] is a key concept: instead of optimising q(z|x) separately for each datapoint, VAEs use a [[Neural Network]] (encoder) to amortize this cost

- This amortization enables efficient inference at scale, making VAEs practical for large datasets

- The encoder network q_φ(z|x) acts as the [[Recognition Model]] or [[Inference Network]]

- The decoder network p_θ(x|z) acts as the [[Generative Model]] or [[Likelihood Model]]

- ## Architecture and Components

- ### Encoder Network (Recognition Model)

- The [[Encoder]] maps input data x to parameters of the latent distribution q(z|x)

- For Gaussian latent variables, the encoder outputs: (μ(x), σ(x)) or (μ(x), log σ²(x))

- Typical encoder architecture for images: [[Convolutional Neural Network|CNN]] with strided convolutions or [[Pooling Layers]]

- For sequential data: [[Recurrent Neural Network|RNN]], [[LSTM]], or [[Transformer]] encoders

- Architecture progression: Input → Conv/FC layers → Latent parameters (μ, σ)

- **Parameterization choices**:
  - Output log σ² instead of σ to ensure positivity and numerical stability
  - Use [[Softplus]] activation for variance: σ = softplus(σ_raw) = log(1 + exp(σ_raw))
  - Alternatively, predict log σ directly and use exp to get σ

- The encoder network is parameterized by weights φ: q_φ(z|x)

- Modern encoders often use [[ResNet]], [[Vision Transformer]], or [[EfficientNet]] backbones for improved feature extraction

- [Updated 2025] Encoders increasingly incorporate [[Attention Mechanisms]] and [[Self-Attention]] for global context

- ### Decoder Network (Generative Model)

- The [[Decoder]] maps latent codes z to reconstructed data x̂ or parameters of p(x|z)

- For continuous data: decoder outputs mean μ_x(z) and optionally variance σ_x²(z)

- For binary data: decoder outputs [[Sigmoid]] activations representing Bernoulli probabilities

- Typical decoder architecture: mirrors encoder with [[Transposed Convolution|transposed convolutions]] or [[Upsampling]]

- Architecture progression: Latent z → FC/Deconv layers → Reconstructed output

- The decoder is parameterized by weights θ: p_θ(x|z)

- **Design considerations**:
  - Use [[Batch Normalization]] or [[Layer Normalization]] for training stability
  - [[Skip Connections]] (from encoder) can improve reconstruction quality
  - Output activation depends on data type: [[Sigmoid]] for [0,1], [[Tanh]] for [-1,1], none for unbounded

- Modern decoders use [[Progressive Growing]], [[StyleGAN]]-inspired architectures, or [[Neural Radiance Fields]] for 3D generation

- ### Latent Space Design

- The [[Latent Space]] is typically a continuous [[Euclidean Space]] ℝ^d with prior p(z) = 𝒩(0, I)

- **Dimensionality selection**:
  - Too low: insufficient capacity to capture data complexity
  - Too high: sparse latent space, difficult sampling
  - Typical ranges: 2-10 for visualization, 32-512 for complex data like images

- The latent space should ideally be:
  - **Continuous**: small changes in z produce small changes in x
  - **Complete**: every point in latent space maps to valid output
  - **Disentangled**: individual latent dimensions correspond to interpretable factors

- [[Latent Traversal]] is a technique to explore the learned space by varying individual dimensions

- The structure of the latent space enables [[Latent Space Interpolation]] between datapoints

- Poor latent space structure can lead to:
  - [[Posterior Collapse]]: encoder ignores input, decoder learns marginal p(x)
  - [[Latent Variable Collapse]]: some dimensions are unused (σ → 0)
  - [[Mode Collapse]]: model fails to capture data diversity

- ### Sampling and Generation

- **Training-time sampling**: z ~ q(z|x) using reparameterization trick

- **Generation-time sampling**: z ~ p(z) from prior distribution

- For standard VAE with Gaussian prior: z ~ 𝒩(0, I)

- **Conditional generation**: Provide conditioning information c to decoder: p(x|z,c)

- **Interpolation**: Generate intermediate samples by interpolating latent codes
  - Linear interpolation: z_t = (1-t)z_1 + t·z_2
  - [[Spherical Interpolation]] (SLERP): better preserves norm in high dimensions

- **Latent arithmetic**: Combine latent codes algebraically (e.g., z_woman - z_man + z_king ≈ z_queen)

- The quality of generated samples depends critically on whether the sampled z lies in a high-density region of the learned posterior

- [Updated 2025] Modern sampling techniques include [[Classifier-Free Guidance]] and [[Latent Diffusion]] applied to VAE latent spaces

- ## Training and Optimization

- ### Training Procedure

- VAE training minimises the negative ELBO (equivalently, maximises ELBO):

- ```python
  def vae_loss(x, x_recon, mu, log_var):
      # Reconstruction loss
      recon_loss = F.mse_loss(x_recon, x, reduction='sum')

      # KL divergence loss
      kl_loss = -0.5 * torch.sum(1 + log_var - mu.pow(2) - log_var.exp())

      return recon_loss + kl_loss
  ```

- Standard [[Stochastic Gradient Descent]], [[Adam Optimizer]], or [[AdamW]] are used for optimization

- Typical hyperparameters [Updated 2025]:
  - Learning rate: 1e-3 to 1e-4 with [[Learning Rate Scheduling]]
  - Batch size: 64-256 depending on data and memory
  - Training epochs: 100-1000 depending on dataset size

- **Warm-up strategies**:
  - [[KL Annealing]]: gradually increase KL weight from 0 to 1 over training
  - Helps prevent early posterior collapse
  - Schedule: β(t) = min(1, t/T_warmup)

- **Best practices**:
  - Monitor reconstruction quality and KL divergence separately
  - Use [[Gradient Clipping]] to prevent exploding gradients
  - Track [[Active Units]] (dimensions with non-trivial variance)
  - Validate on held-out data using ELBO, not just reconstruction loss

- ### Preventing Posterior Collapse

- [[Posterior Collapse]] occurs when the encoder learns to ignore the input, reducing to q(z|x) ≈ p(z)

- This causes the decoder to learn the marginal distribution p(x) without using latent information

- **Detection**: KL divergence approaches zero, reconstruction degrades but doesn't improve with more epochs

- **Solutions**:
  - **KL annealing**: Start with β=0 and gradually increase
  - **Free bits**: Allow some KL divergence before penalizing: max(λ, KL(q||p))
  - **δ-VAE**: Add minimum KL constraint per latent dimension
  - **Aggressive decoder**: Use weaker decoder architecture to force reliance on latent code
  - **Auxiliary losses**: Add auxiliary tasks that require latent information

- [Updated 2025] Modern architectures use [[Transformer Decoders]] with [[Masked Attention]] to prevent collapse

- ### Optimization Challenges

- **Local minima**: VAE loss landscape can have many local optima

- **KL-reconstruction tradeoff**: Difficult to balance both objectives simultaneously

- **Hyperparameter sensitivity**: β, learning rate, architecture choices significantly impact results

- **Computational cost**: Each forward pass requires sampling, increasing variance

- **Solutions and techniques**:
  - [[Multiple Importance Sampling]]: Reduce variance in ELBO estimation
  - [[Importance Weighted Autoencoders]] (IWAE): Tighter ELBO bound using multiple samples
  - [[Normalizing Flows]]: More flexible posterior approximations

- [[Beta-VAE]] introduces a hyperparameter β to the KL term: ℒ = Reconstruction Loss + β·KL Divergence

- Proposed by Higgins et al. (2017) to encourage [[Disentangled Representation|disentangled representations]]
