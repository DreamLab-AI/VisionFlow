## Academic Context

- Brief contextual overview
	- Digital curation platforms are integrated systems designed to support the lifecycle management of digital cultural heritage, including acquisition, organisation, preservation, and access
	- The field draws from library and information science, digital humanities, and data management, with a strong emphasis on long-term stewardship and reuse
	- Key developments and current state
		- Platforms now routinely support complex metadata schemas, persistent identifiers, and interoperability with research infrastructures
		- The rise of distributed and immersive environments (including metaverse applications) has expanded the scope of curation beyond traditional repositories
	- Academic foundations
		- Rooted in archival science and museology, with increasing influence from computer science and data ethics
		- The Digital Curation Centre (DCC) in the UK has played a pivotal role in shaping best practices and standards

## Current Landscape (2025)

- Industry adoption and implementations
	- Digital curation platforms are widely adopted by cultural heritage institutions, universities, and research organisations
	- Notable organisations and platforms
		- The British Library’s Digital Preservation team utilises advanced curation platforms for national collections
		- The National Archives (UK) employs robust systems for managing digital records and heritage materials
		- The University of Manchester’s John Rylands Research Institute and Library has developed bespoke curation solutions for rare and unique collections
		- The Leeds Museums and Galleries service leverages digital curation tools to manage and present regional heritage assets
		- Newcastle University’s Digital Cultures Research Group supports curation of digital art and cultural data
		- Sheffield’s Weston Park Museum and Museums Sheffield have implemented digital curation platforms for local history and community engagement
	- UK and North England examples where relevant
		- The North East Digital Heritage Network (NEDHN) fosters collaboration among regional institutions on digital curation initiatives
		- The Yorkshire and Humber Digital Heritage Forum supports cross-sector knowledge exchange
- Technical capabilities and limitations
	- Platforms typically offer version control, metadata management, access controls, and integration with digital asset management (DAM) systems
	- Limitations include scalability challenges, interoperability with legacy systems, and the need for ongoing staff training
	- Emerging platforms are beginning to support immersive and interactive experiences, including virtual exhibitions and metaverse environments
- Standards and frameworks
	- Widely adopted standards include OAIS (Open Archival Information System), PREMIS (Preservation Metadata Implementation Strategies), and Dublin Core
	- The DCC’s Curation Lifecycle Model provides a comprehensive framework for digital curation activities
