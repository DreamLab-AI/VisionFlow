## Proximal Policy Optimisation

Proximal Policy Optimisation refers to a reinforcement learning algorithm that updates policies through incremental steps whilst constraining how much the policy can change, preventing destabilising updates. ppo is the standard rl algorithm used in rlhf for optimising language models based on reward model feedback.

- PPO remains one of the most widely adopted RL algorithms due to its robustness, ease of implementation, and competitive performance.
  - It is extensively used in domains ranging from robotics and control tasks to natural language processing and game playing.
- Recent enhancements, such as PPO+ (Kallel et al., 2025), improve stability and efficiency by incorporating proper action bounds, off-policy critic training, and entropy bonuses, reducing hyperparameter sensitivity.
- Technical capabilities:
  - PPO supports multiple epochs of stochastic gradient ascent per policy update, improving data efficiency over Trust Region Policy Optimisation (TRPO).
  - Limitations include sensitivity to hyperparameters and challenges in complex, high-dimensional environments.
- Standards and frameworks:
  - PPO is implemented in major RL libraries such as PyTorch’s TorchRL, OpenAI Baselines, and Stable Baselines3.
  - It is often integrated into pipelines for training large language models and autonomous agents.
