## AI Office

AI Office refers to commission body established as the centre of ai expertise forming the foundation for a single european ai governance system, with primary responsibility for supervising general-purpose ai models and coordinating market surveillance.

- The AI Office became operational on 2 August 2025, coinciding with the applicability of key obligations under the AI Act for GPAI models.
  - It collaborates closely with the European Artificial Intelligence Board, national competent authorities, and market surveillance bodies to enforce compliance and harmonise regulatory practices.
  - Providers of GPAI models must maintain technical documentation, publish training data summaries, and implement copyright compliance policies.
  - Additional stringent requirements apply to GPAI models identified as posing systemic risks, including cybersecurity measures and incident reporting.
- Industry adoption spans sectors such as healthcare, manufacturing, mobility, and climate, with the AI Office supporting innovation through initiatives like GenAI4EU.
- UK and North England examples:
  - While the UK is no longer an EU Member State, its AI research and innovation hubs in Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield remain influential in European AI discourse.
  - These cities host leading AI research centres and startups contributing to trustworthy AI development, often aligning with EU standards to maintain market access.
- Technical capabilities of GPAI models include wide-ranging task competence and integration flexibility, but limitations persist in explainability, bias mitigation, and systemic risk management.
- Standards and frameworks are evolving, with the AI Office providing guidance and clarifications to ensure consistent interpretation and application of the AI Act across Member States.
