## Academic Context

- Brief contextual overview
	- Model Predictive Control (MPC) is an advanced control strategy that uses dynamic models of a system to predict future behaviour and optimise control actions over a finite horizon
	- At each time step, MPC solves an optimisation problem to determine the best sequence of control inputs, implementing only the first action before re-optimising at the next step
	- This approach is particularly effective for systems with constraints, multivariable interactions, and complex dynamics

- Key developments and current state
	- MPC has evolved from linear, deterministic formulations to include nonlinear, stochastic, and robust variants, broadening its applicability across engineering domains
	- Recent advances integrate machine learning and data-driven techniques to improve model accuracy and reduce computational burden

- Academic foundations
	- MPC is rooted in optimal control theory, with foundational work dating back to the 1960s and 1970s
	- The technique gained prominence in process industries and has since expanded into automotive, energy, and manufacturing sectors

## Current Landscape (2025)

- Industry adoption and implementations
	- MPC is widely used in chemical processing, energy management, automotive control, and advanced manufacturing
	- Leading platforms include MATLAB/Simulink, DYMOLA, TRNSYS, EnergyPlus, and ESP-r for simulation and control design
	- In the UK, MPC is increasingly adopted in smart grid management, building energy optimisation, and industrial automation

- Notable organisations and platforms
	- Siemens, ABB, and Schneider Electric offer MPC-based solutions for industrial control
	- UK-based companies such as Spirax Sarco and Johnson Matthey utilise MPC for process optimisation

- UK and North England examples where relevant
	- The University of Manchester’s Energy Research Institute applies MPC for smart building energy management
	- Leeds City Council has piloted MPC-driven demand response systems in municipal buildings
	- Newcastle University’s Smart Grids Research Group uses MPC for grid-scale energy storage optimisation
	- Sheffield’s Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC) employs MPC for precision control in additive manufacturing

- Technical capabilities and limitations
	- MPC excels at handling constraints, multivariable systems, and predictive optimisation
	- Computational complexity remains a challenge, particularly for real-time applications with large-scale or nonlinear models
	- Recent advances in machine learning and digital twin technologies are helping to mitigate these limitations

- Standards and frameworks
	- Industry standards such as IEC 61131-3 and ISA-88 provide guidance for control system implementation
	- Open-source frameworks like CasADi and ACADO are widely used for MPC research and development
