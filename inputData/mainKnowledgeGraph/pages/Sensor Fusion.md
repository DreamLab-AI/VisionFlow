## Sensor Fusion

Sensor Fusion refers to sensor fusion is the process of combining data from multiple sensors (camera, lidar, radar, gps, imu) to produce more accurate, reliable, and complete information than could be obtained from any individual sensor. sensor fusion employs algorithms including kalman filtering, particle filtering, and deep learning-based fusion to integrate complementary sensor modalities whilst managing sensor noise, uncertainties, and failures.

- Sensor fusion is widely adopted in automotive Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles, combining inputs from cameras, LiDAR, radar, GPS, and inertial measurement units (IMUs).
  - Algorithms fuse complementary sensor modalities to enhance object detection, localisation, and scene understanding while managing sensor noise, uncertainties, and failures.
  - Beyond automotive, sensor fusion supports robotics, telemedicine, industrial automation, and environmental monitoring.
- Notable organisations include automotive suppliers like Aptiv and technology firms such as QNX (BlackBerry), which develop sensor fusion software stacks for safety-critical applications.
- UK and North England examples:
  - Research hubs in Manchester and Leeds focus on sensor fusion for autonomous systems and smart city applications.
  - Newcastle University conducts advanced research in multi-sensor data fusion for robotics and environmental sensing.
  - Sheffield’s innovation centres explore sensor fusion in manufacturing and healthcare technologies.
- Technical capabilities have improved with advances in AI, enabling real-time fusion of high-dimensional data streams.
- Limitations remain in sensor cost, computational complexity, and robustness under adverse conditions.
- Standards and frameworks for sensor fusion are evolving, with ISO and SAE developing guidelines for automotive sensor integration and safety assurance.
