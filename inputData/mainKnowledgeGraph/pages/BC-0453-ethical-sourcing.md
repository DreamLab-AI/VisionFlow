- ## About Ethical Sourcing
	- Blockchain-enabled systems for verifying and tracking ethical sourcing practices across global supply chains, ensuring transparency in fair trade certification, conflict mineral tracking, labour standards compliance, and responsible procurement. These solutions address the £350 billion annual cost of unethical sourcing practices globally whilst providing immutable verification of worker welfare, living wages, and environmental standards. Major implementations include Tony's Chocolonely's cocoa traceability system tracking 15,000+ farmers, Fairtrade International's blockchain pilots covering 1.9 million producers, and the Responsible Minerals Initiative's conflict-free verification network spanning 400+ companies across electronics, automotive, and aerospace industries.
