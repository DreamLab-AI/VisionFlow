## Path Planning

Path Planning refers to path planning is the algorithmic process of determining an optimal or feasible geometric path from a start location to a goal location whilst avoiding obstacles, adhering to constraints, and optimising objectives such as distance, time, safety, or energy consumption. path planning algorithms range from graph-based methods (a*, dijkstra) to sampling-based methods (rrt, prm) and optimisation-based methods for autonomous navigation.

- Path planning represents a foundational challenge in robotics and autonomous systems, addressing the fundamental problem of navigating from origin to destination whilst circumventing obstacles
  - The field encompasses multiple algorithmic paradigms, each with distinct computational characteristics and applicability profiles
  - Classical approaches (graph-based methods) provide deterministic solutions with high precision in structured environments
  - Modern approaches integrate probabilistic sampling, heuristic optimisation, and machine learning to handle increasingly complex, dynamic scenarios
  - The discipline has matured from theoretical computer science into practical engineering, with applications spanning industrial automation, autonomous vehicles, and agricultural robotics

## Current Landscape (2025)

- **Algorithm Categories and Technical Capabilities**
  - Traditional classical algorithms (A*, Dijkstra) deliver high precision and stability in structured farmland and warehouse environments, though they lack dynamic adaptability to real-time environmental changes
  - Modern intelligent bionic algorithms (Harris Hawk Optimizer, particle swarm optimisation) enhance path robustness in complex terrains through group collaboration and global optimisation mechanisms, though convergence remains computationally demanding and parameter sensitivity presents tuning challenges
  - Sampling-based planning algorithms (RRT, PRM, Bi-RRT variants) excel in obstacle avoidance within unstructured, dynamic scenarios; however, path quality depends critically upon sampling strategy implementation
  - Machine learning and deep reinforcement learning approaches enable environment-adaptive decision-making through data-driven mechanisms, though they require substantial labelled training data and significant computational resources
  - Recent innovations include phase search-enhanced Bi-RRT algorithms incorporating three-phase search strategies and path pruning mechanisms, which demonstrably improve convergence speed and reduce superfluous nodes in complex obstacle environments
  - Integrated approaches combining Dijkstra algorithms with nature-inspired optimisers show promise for balancing computational efficiency with solution quality
- **Industry Adoption and Implementations**
  - Agricultural robotics represent a significant adoption vector, with path planning algorithms enabling autonomous navigation across variable terrain and dynamic crop environments
  - Autonomous vehicle platforms increasingly employ hybrid algorithmic approaches, integrating multiple algorithm strengths to improve real-time performance and adaptability
