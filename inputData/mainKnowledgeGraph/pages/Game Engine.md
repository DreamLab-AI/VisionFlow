- ## About Game Engines
  id:: gameengine-about
	- Game Engines are **foundational software platforms** that provide the runtime infrastructure for creating and running interactive virtual experiences. They serve as comprehensive frameworks integrating rendering, physics, audio, input, networking, and scripting capabilities into unified development environments. Modern game engines power not only video games but also virtual worlds, metaverse platforms, architectural visualization, training simulations, and real-time digital production.
	- Game engines abstract complex low-level operations—such as graphics API calls, memory management, and hardware acceleration—into higher-level interfaces accessible to developers and content creators. This abstraction enables rapid prototyping and cross-platform deployment while maintaining real-time performance requirements of 30-120+ frames per second. Engines like Unity, Unreal Engine, and Godot have become essential infrastructure for the metaverse, providing the technical foundation for immersive experiences.
	- The evolution of game engines reflects broader trends in computer graphics, from fixed-function pipelines to programmable shaders to modern ray tracing. Today's engines incorporate machine learning, cloud streaming, procedural generation, and sophisticated asset pipelines. They increasingly support open standards for interoperability, enabling assets and experiences to function across multiple platforms and metaverse environments.
