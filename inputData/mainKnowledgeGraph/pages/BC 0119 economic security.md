- ## About BC 0119 Economic Security

	- ### Primary Definition
		- **Economic security** in [[blockchain]] systems refers to the resilience of a blockchain network against attacks, achieved by aligning the economic incentives of participants so that honest behaviour is more profitable than malicious behaviour [Updated 2025].
		- It is underpinned by the principle that the **cost of attacking the network should exceed any potential gains**, making attacks economically irrational [[attack cost economics]] [[cryptoeconomics]].
		- This creates a [[Nash equilibrium]] where no individual participant benefits from deviating from protocol rules.

	- ### Technical Definition
		- A formally-defined component of blockchain architecture using [[game theory]], [[cryptographic]] primitives, and economic incentives to ensure network security and [[consensus mechanism]] integrity.
		- Economic security mechanisms include [[proof-of-work]] mining costs, [[proof-of-stake]] validator bonds, [[slashing]] penalties, and transaction fees that collectively make malicious actions economically prohibitive.

	- ### Core Principles [Updated 2025]
		- **Incentive Alignment**: Ensures that the interests of network participants (miners, validators, users) are aligned with the health and security of the blockchain
		- **Attack Cost Economics**: The economic cost of executing an attack must exceed potential rewards
		- **Cryptoeconomic Guarantees**: Protocol-level rules that make dishonest behaviour financially irrational
		- **Game-Theoretic Security**: Strategic interaction modelling ensures participants are incentivized to act honestly

## Game Theory and Economic Security

- ### Game Theory Foundations
	- **Game theory** is used to model the strategic interactions among rational participants (nodes, miners, validators) in a decentralized network [[cryptoeconomics]].
	- By designing protocols where participants are incentivized to act honestly, blockchain systems create a **Nash equilibrium**: no individual participant benefits from deviating from the protocol rules.
	- Example: In [[Bitcoin]]'s [[Proof of Work]] (PoW), miners compete to solve cryptographic puzzles. The reward for mining a block is only valid if the block is accepted by the network, so miners are incentivized to follow consensus rules to receive rewards.

- ### Incentive Alignment Mechanisms [Updated 2025]
	- **Proof-of-Work Systems**
		- Miners are rewarded with block rewards and transaction fees for validating transactions and adding blocks to the chain
		- This makes it more profitable to contribute to the network than to attack it
		- The computational cost of mining creates a natural economic barrier to attacks
		- [[Bitcoin]] demonstrates this model with mining rewards and difficulty adjustments

	- **Proof-of-Stake Systems**
		- Validators must stake their own cryptocurrency as collateral
		- Honest validators are rewarded with block rewards and transaction fees
		- Malicious validators risk losing their stake through [[slashing]], creating a strong economic disincentive for dishonesty
		- Staking models require validators to deposit a bond proportional to the value they are securing, further aligning their incentives with network integrity
		- [[Ethereum]], [[Cosmos]], and [[Polkadot]] implement sophisticated staking and slashing mechanisms

- ### Economic Incentive Mechanisms
	- **Block Rewards**: New tokens created and distributed to miners/validators for producing valid blocks
	- **Transaction Fees**: Payments from users to miners/validators for including transactions in blocks
	- **Slashing Penalties**: Confiscation of staked assets from validators who violate protocol rules
	- **Validator Bonds**: Locked collateral that can be forfeited for dishonest actions
	- **MEV (Maximal Extractable Value)**: Economic value extracted from transaction ordering and inclusion

## Attack Cost Economics

- ### Proof of Work (PoW) Attack Economics [Updated 2025]
	- **51% Attack Cost**
		- The cost of launching a [[51% attack]] (gaining control of the majority of the network's computational power) requires massive investment in hardware and energy
		- The potential rewards from an attack are usually less than the cost, making such attacks economically unfeasible
		- Attack cost scales with network [[hash rate]] and hardware requirements
		- For [[Bitcoin]], the cost to execute a sustained 51% attack is estimated in billions of dollars, making it economically irrational

	- **Mining Hardware Economics**
		- Attackers must purchase substantial mining hardware to directly control network hash power
		- This approach requires significant capital investment and is most feasible against smaller networks with lower total hash rates
		- Hardware depreciation and opportunity costs further increase attack expenses

	- **Energy Cost Analysis**
		- Mining requires continuous electricity consumption
		- Attack costs include not just hardware but ongoing energy expenses
		- Geographic distribution of mining power increases coordination costs for attackers

- ### Proof of Stake (PoS) Attack Economics [Updated 2025]
	- **Economic Security Model**
		- The cost of attacking a PoS network is the value of the staked tokens that would be lost if the validator acts maliciously
		- The total value locked in staking ([[TVL]]) is a key metric for economic security: the higher the TVL, the more expensive an attack becomes
		- [[Slashing]] mechanisms further increase the cost of attacks by penalizing validators who deviate from protocol rules

	- **Attack Vector Analysis**
		- Accumulating sufficient stake to control consensus
		- Costs include opportunity cost of capital locked in stake
		- Risk of [[slashing]] penalties for malicious behaviour
		- Loss of future rewards from being ejected from validator set

	- **2024-2025 Security Metrics** [Updated 2025]
		- **Ethereum**: Post-merge PoS with over 30 million ETH staked (~$60+ billion USD at 2025 prices), making attacks economically prohibitive
		- **Cosmos Hub**: Significant ATOM stake required for meaningful attack vectors
		- **Polkadot**: High DOT staking requirements with sophisticated slashing mechanisms

## 51% Attack: Detailed Analysis

- ### Definition and Core Mechanism
	- A [[51% attack]] occurs when a single entity or group gains control of more than 50% of a blockchain network's computing power or mining hash rate
	- This majority control allows attackers to manipulate the network's consensus mechanism and transaction validation process
	- The attack exploits the fundamental security model of Proof-of-Work blockchains, which rely on distributed consensus where the chain with the most accumulated computational work is considered valid

- ### Attack Methodology [Updated 2025]
	- When an attacker controls majority hash power, they can build an alternative blockchain faster than the honest network can extend the legitimate chain
	- Once the attacker's chain accumulates more total work than the main chain, all network nodes automatically switch to the attacker's version following the "rule of the chain with the most work done"
	- This allows attackers to:
		- Reverse previously confirmed transactions ([[double-spending]])
		- Block new transactions from being confirmed
		- Prevent other miners from mining valid blocks
		- Execute [[double-spending attack]]s against exchanges

- ### Real-World Examples [Updated 2025]
	- **Ethereum Classic (2019-2020)**
		- January 2019: Two separate 51% attacks on January 5th and 7th
		- August 2020: Three additional 51% attacks
		- Financial Impact: Attackers successfully double-spent millions of dollars worth of ETC
		- In one documented case, approximately $1.1 million worth of ETC was involved in double-spending
		- Attack Methodology: Targeted cryptocurrency exchanges by depositing ETC, then reversing the transaction on an alternative chain while converting stolen funds to other cryptocurrencies like Monero

	- **Bitcoin Gold (BTG)**
		- Multiple 51% attacks resulting in over $70,000 in losses
		- Demonstrated vulnerability of smaller proof-of-work chains

	- **Vertcoin (VTC)**
		- December 2018: 51% attack with blockchain reorganization
		- Highlighted risks for coins with lower hash rates

	- **Bitcoin (BTC) Resilience**
		- Bitcoin has remained unchallenged since its inception despite being the most valuable target
		- This resilience stems from Satoshi Nakamoto's consensus mechanism combined with Bitcoin's massive distributed hash rate
		- Attack costs exceed tens of billions of dollars, making attacks economically prohibitive

- ### Economic Analysis of Attack Costs [Updated 2025]
	- **Hardware Acquisition Costs**
		- Direct purchase of mining equipment
		- Most feasible against smaller networks with lower total hash rates
		- Hardware depreciation reduces residual value post-attack

	- **Mining Power Rental Services**
		- Rental services have dramatically reduced attack costs
		- Allows attackers to purchase hash power on a marginal cost basis without long-term hardware commitments
		- Many Proof-of-Work altcoins have multiple times their network hash rate available for rent
		- This has made attacks on smaller networks economically feasible

	- **Opportunity Costs**
		- Capital locked in attack infrastructure
		- Foregone legitimate mining rewards
		- Risk of network value collapse post-attack reducing attack profitability

- ### Network Vulnerability Factors
	- **Hash Rate Distribution**
		- Smaller networks with less distributed hash power face substantially higher risks
		- Larger networks like Bitcoin with more distributed hash power are exponentially more resistant to attacks
		- The relationship is direct: as a coin becomes more attractive, its price rises, miners receive greater rewards, hash power increases, and attack feasibility decreases

	- **Mining Pool Concentration**
		- Concentration of hash power in few mining pools increases attack risk
		- Geographic distribution of mining provides additional security
		- [[Nakamoto Coefficient]] measures minimum entities needed to compromise network

## Slashing Mechanisms in Proof-of-Stake

- ### Definition and Purpose [Updated 2025]
	- **[[Slashing]]** mechanisms are automated protocols in [[proof-of-stake]] (PoS) blockchains that penalize validators for violating consensus rules
	- Violations include double-signing, downtime, equivocation, or other malicious or negligent actions
	- Validators must stake their own assets as collateral; if they break protocol rules, a portion of their stake is slashed (destroyed or confiscated), and they may be ejected from the validator set

- ### Economic Penalties
	- **Primary Penalty**: Loss of staked tokens, ranging from small percentages for minor infractions to significant losses for severe violations
	- **Delegator Impact**: In most PoS networks, delegators (those who stake with a validator) also share in the penalty proportionally, amplifying the risk across the staking pool
	- **Token Burning**: Slashed tokens are typically burned (removed from circulation), making the loss irreversible
	- **Additional Penalties**:
		- Forced ejection from the validator set (removal from active participation)
		- Temporary or permanent bans (e.g., "tombstoning" in Cosmos)
		- Loss of future reward opportunities

- ### Validator Incentives
	- The threat of slashing creates a strong economic incentive for validators to act honestly and maintain high uptime
	- Validators must carefully manage their infrastructure and avoid actions that could be interpreted as malicious or negligent
	- Even operational mistakes can trigger slashing, incentivizing professional validator operations
	- The risk of slashing also incentivizes delegators to choose reliable validators, as their own stake is at risk

- ### Implementation in Major Blockchains [Updated 2025]
	- **Ethereum**
		- **Slashing Conditions**: Double-signing, surround voting, double voting
		- **Penalties**: Initial loss (up to 1 ETH or ~3-4% of validator's stake), forced exit, correlation penalty if multiple validators slashed simultaneously
		- **Process**: Slashed ETH is burned, validator cannot rejoin until after lengthy withdrawal period (~36 days)
		- **2024-2025 Statistics**: Slashing rates remain below 0.05% of active validators per year, with most incidents due to operational errors (misconfigured clients, double-signing during upgrades)

	- **Cosmos**
		- **Slashing Conditions**: Double-signing results in 5% stake loss and "tombstoning" (permanent ban); extended downtime triggers small penalty (0.01%)
		- **Validator States**: Jailed (temporarily banned) or tombstoned (permanently banned)
		- **Customization**: Penalties predefined but can be customised by individual Cosmos SDK-based chains
		- **2024-2025 Statistics**: Double-signing events infrequent, most slashing due to downtime

	- **Polkadot**
		- **Slashing Conditions**: Double-signing, equivocation, downtime
		- **Penalties**: Scale with size of validator set and severity (0.1% to over 30% of stake)
		- **Collective Slashing**: May occur if multiple validators misbehave simultaneously
		- **2024-2025 Statistics**: Low slashing incidents, most for equivocation or downtime with penalties typically below 1%

- ### Best Practices for Validators
	- Implement robust monitoring systems
	- Use secure key management (hardware security modules)
	- Avoid running multiple instances with the same keys
	- Maintain high uptime with redundant infrastructure
	- Regularly update client software
	- Monitor network conditions and protocol changes

## Economic Finality

- ### Definition [Updated 2025]
	- **[[Economic finality]]** means a transaction is considered irreversible because reversing it would be economically irrational or infeasible for validators
	- This is achieved through financial penalties and cryptoeconomic guarantees built into the protocol
	- Distinct from **probabilistic finality** (as in Proof-of-Work), where transaction certainty increases over time but is never absolute
	- In PoS, finality is often achieved much faster and with greater certainty

- ### Validator Bonds and Economic Stakes
	- Validators must lock up significant cryptocurrency as a **stake** (bond or collateral) to participate in block validation
	- If a validator acts maliciously (approving conflicting transactions, attempting to revert finalised blocks), their staked assets are subject to slashing (partial or total forfeiture)
	- The size of the stake directly correlates with the cost of attacking the network: the more value at risk, the higher the economic deterrent against dishonest behaviour
	- This creates a strong alignment between validator economic interests and network security

- ### Cryptoeconomic Guarantees
	- **Protocol-level rules** align validator incentives with honest behaviour by making attacks prohibitively expensive
	- Example: In Ethereum's PoS (post-Merge), a block is finalised when at least two-thirds of validators (by stake) attest to it
	- If a validator tries to finalise conflicting blocks, they lose their stake, making double-spending or chain reversion economically irrational
	- This mechanism is akin to a legally binding contract with severe financial penalties for breach
	- Once a transaction is finalised, it is practically irreversible

- ### How Economic Finality Works [Updated 2025]
	- **Economic finality** is reached when the cost of reversing a transaction (via collusion or attack) exceeds any potential gain
	- This makes reversal actions unprofitable and therefore unlikely
	- Key mechanisms:
		- **Validator bonds**: Locked collateral that can be forfeited for dishonest actions
		- **Economic stakes**: Total value at risk determines cost of attacks
		- **Slashing/penalties**: Protocol-enforced financial losses for malicious or negligent behaviour
		- **Consensus threshold**: Typically two-thirds of staked validators must agree for finality
		- **Cryptoeconomic guarantees**: Combined effect makes transaction reversal economically irrational

- ### Recent Research (2024-2025) [Updated 2025]
	- IMF's 2025 primer on blockchain consensus mechanisms: PoS systems achieve finality by "imposing economic costs on validators for dishonest behaviour, thereby ensuring a single consistent and honest ledger"
	- Contemporary research emphasises that security and finality of PoS blockchains depend on:
		- Total value staked
		- Effectiveness of slashing conditions
		- Higher stakes and stricter penalties lead to stronger economic finality
	- PoS-based economic finality is critical for scalability and trustworthiness of [[DeFi]], [[NFT]]s, and advanced blockchain applications in 2025

- ### Limitations and Considerations
	- While economic finality is robust, it is not mathematically absolute
	- A sufficiently large, well-coordinated, and well-funded attack could theoretically revert finalised transactions
	- This is considered highly improbable in well-designed PoS systems
	- Research continues into optimising slashing conditions and stake distribution to strengthen economic finality
