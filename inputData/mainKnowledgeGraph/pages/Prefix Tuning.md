## Prefix Tuning

Prefix Tuning refers to a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique that prepends trainable continuous vectors (prefixes) to the key and value matrices at each transformer layer, whilst keeping the pre-trained model parameters frozen. unlike prompt tuning which only modifies input embeddings, prefix tuning affects attention computation at every layer.

- Prefix tuning remains a popular PEFT method due to its computational efficiency and strong performance, especially in low-data or few-shot learning scenarios.
  - It is widely implemented in industry and research for adapting large language models (LLMs) without incurring the high costs of full fine-tuning.
  - Notable platforms supporting prefix tuning include Hugging Face’s Transformers library and various open-source PEFT toolkits.
- Technical capabilities:
  - Prefix tuning preserves the input sequence length and integrates seamlessly with the transformer’s multi-head attention, allowing task-specific adaptation without altering the model’s architecture.
  - Recent advances, such as Prefix-Tuning+ and Prefix-RFT, have enhanced prefix tuning by decoupling prefixes from attention or blending supervised and reinforcement fine-tuning, respectively, improving stability and performance on complex tasks.
- Limitations:
  - While parameter-efficient, prefix tuning may underperform full fine-tuning on tasks requiring extensive model reconfiguration.
  - Some modern large models show diminishing returns with vanilla prefix tuning, prompting research into hybrid or enhanced variants.
- Standards and frameworks:
  - PEFT methods, including prefix tuning, are increasingly standardised within ML frameworks, promoting reproducibility and interoperability.
