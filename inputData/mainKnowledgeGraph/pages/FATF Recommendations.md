## FATF Recommendations

FATF Recommendations refers to a component of the blockchain ecosystem.

- FATF Recommendations continue to shape global AML/CFT regulatory regimes, with particular emphasis on virtual assets and VASPs.
  - The 2025 targeted update highlights ongoing challenges such as fragmented enforcement, anonymity in virtual asset transfers, and sophisticated illicit finance schemes including state-sponsored cybercrime and fraud.
  - The Travel Rule (Recommendation 16) remains a core tool, requiring VASPs and financial institutions to collect and share originator and beneficiary information for virtual asset transfers above specified thresholds, aligning crypto transactions with traditional wire transfer standards.
  - Notable organisations implementing these standards include global crypto exchanges, custodians, and compliance technology providers like Notabene, which facilitate secure Travel Rule compliance.
- In the UK, regulatory frameworks are evolving under the Financial Services and Markets Bill, enhancing the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) powers over stablecoins and crypto consumer protections while fostering innovation through regulatory sandboxes.
- Technical capabilities have improved with standardised information requirements and emerging technologies for fraud prevention, though limitations persist in cross-jurisdictional enforcement and real-time data sharing.
- FATF’s 2025 update also introduces clarifications on payment chain responsibilities and exemptions for card transactions related to goods and services, effective by 2030.

- Ongoing research focuses on enhancing interoperability of compliance technologies, improving risk assessment models for virtual assets, and evaluating the socio-economic impacts of AML/CFT regulations on innovation.

## UK Context

- The UK plays a significant role in implementing FATF Recommendations, with the FCA actively regulating crypto assets and VASPs.
  - The Financial Services and Markets Bill (2025) strengthens regulatory oversight, particularly for stablecoins, and introduces consumer protection measures tailored to crypto users.
- North England, including innovation hubs in Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield, is emerging as a centre for blockchain and fintech innovation, with several startups and academic institutions collaborating on compliance technology and AML solutions.
  - For example, Manchester-based firms are developing AI-driven transaction monitoring tools aligned with FATF standards.
- Regional case studies highlight the balance between fostering fintech innovation and ensuring robust AML/CFT compliance, reflecting the UK's broader regulatory philosophy.

## Future Directions

- Emerging trends include:
  - Greater standardisation and automation of Travel Rule compliance using blockchain analytics and secure data-sharing protocols.
  - Expansion of AML/CFT frameworks to cover decentralised finance (DeFi) and non-custodial wallet providers.
- Anticipated challenges involve:
  - Harmonising international regulatory approaches to reduce enforcement gaps exploited by illicit actors.
  - Balancing privacy concerns with transparency requirements in virtual asset transactions.
- Research priorities focus on developing scalable compliance technologies, assessing regulatory impacts on market dynamics, and exploring ethical frameworks for data sharing in AML/CFT.
