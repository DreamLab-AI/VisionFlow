  - **Definition**
    - definition:: AI Risk refers to the composite measure combining the probability of occurrence and magnitude of potential adverse consequences arising from the design, development, deployment, operation, or use of artificial intelligence systems that may cause harm, damage, violations, or negative impacts affecting individuals, groups, organizations, communities, society, or the environment, encompassing diverse risk categories including technical risks (performance failures, robustness issues, model drift, adversarial vulnerabilities), ethical risks (bias and discrimination, fairness violations, autonomy erosion, value misalignment), privacy and security risks (data breaches, privacy violations, membership inference, model extraction, adversarial attacks), safety risks (physical harm from autonomous systems, critical infrastructure failures, unintended consequences), legal and compliance risks (regulatory violations, liability exposure, intellectual property infringement), operational risks (deployment failures, integration issues, resource constraints, maintainability challenges), reputational risks (public backlash, stakeholder concerns, brand damage), societal risks (labor displacement, inequality amplification, democratic erosion, epistemic harms), and existential risks (loss of human control over advanced AI systems, civilization-scale catastrophic outcomes). This comprehensive risk framework characterizes risks across multiple dimensions: likelihood (rare, unlikely, possible, likely, almost certain), impact or severity (insignificant, minor, moderate, major, catastrophic), velocity (time from manifestation to impact), persistence (duration of adverse effects), scope (number and types of affected stakeholders), reversibility (ability to remediate consequences), and detectability (ease of identification before significant harm occurs). AI-specific risk characteristics distinguish AI risk from traditional technology risk through opacity and interpretability challenges whereby complex models function as "black boxes" making risk identification difficult, autonomy and adaptability enabling systems to learn and evolve in ways that diverge from design intentions, data dependency creating risks from training data quality, bias, representativeness, and privacy, scaling effects where deployment across millions of decisions amplifies impact of small error rates or biases, emergent behaviors arising from system interactions that cannot be predicted from individual components, value alignment challenges ensuring AI objectives match human values and intentions, and dual-use potential enabling beneficial technologies to cause harm through misuse. Risk management approaches follow structured frameworks including ISO/IEC 23894:2023 AI risk management guidance adapting ISO 31000 for AI-specific contexts, NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0, updated with Generative AI Profile NIST-AI-600-1 addressing unique generative AI risks), EU AI Act risk-based regulatory framework categorizing systems as unacceptable, high, limited, or minimal risk with proportionate requirements, and sector-specific frameworks from healthcare (FDA), finance (prudential regulators), and critical infrastructure. Contemporary AI risk concerns in 2024-2025 include prompt injection attacks exploiting large language models, model drift degrading performance as real-world conditions evolve, bias incidents in hiring and lending, privacy breaches from training data leakage, deepfakes and AI-generated misinformation eroding epistemic trust, AI-powered cyber threats, autonomous weapons and dual-use concerns, labor market disruption affecting vulnerable populations, and alignment challenges as AI capabilities approach and potentially exceed human-level performance in narrow and eventually broad domains.

- ## Definition and Scope

  Artificial Intelligence Risk refers to the potential for AI systems to cause adverse effects on individuals, groups, organizations, communities, or society at large. These risks arise from technical failures, security vulnerabilities, biased outcomes, privacy violations, or unintended consequences during AI system design, deployment, or operation.

  The academic foundations of AI risk management draw from computer science, ethics, cybersecurity, and social sciences, emphasising interdisciplinary approaches to understand and mitigate harm. According to the NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0, January 2023), AI risk is defined as the composite measure of an event's probability of occurring and the magnitude or degree of the consequences of the corresponding event.

- ## Formal Specification

  ### Primary Standards and Frameworks

	- #### ISO/IEC 23894:2023 - AI Risk Management
	  Published February 2023, this comprehensive international standard for [[AI Risk Management]] adapts traditional risk management practices (ISO 31000) to AI's unique characteristics including opacity, complexity, autonomy, and data dependency. The standard gained widespread adoption throughout 2024-2025 as organizations sought structured risk management methodologies. Implementation requires cross-functional collaboration between data scientists, security professionals, legal counsel, and business leaders.

	- #### NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0)
	  Released January 2023, updated with Generative AI Profile (NIST-AI-600-1) on July 26, 2024. The Profile added over 200 specific actions addressing unique risks including CBRN information risks, confabulation (hallucinations), dangerous or hateful content generation, data privacy violations, information integrity issues (deepfakes), intellectual property infringement, and obscene content generation. This framework became essential for organizations deploying [[Large Language Models]], image generators, and multimodal systems.

	- #### EU AI Act (Regulation 2024/1689)
	  Finalized June 2024, entered into force August 1, 2024. The risk-based regulatory framework categorises AI systems as unacceptable, high, limited, or minimal risk, establishing the global template for risk-proportionate regulation. **[Updated 2025]** Implementation proceeds on schedule with phased obligations. Prohibited practices became effective February 2, 2025. Major provisions including GPAI models, governance, and penalties apply from August 2, 2025. Full high-risk AI system requirements take effect August 2, 2026. Non-compliance penalties reach up to €35 million or 7% of worldwide annual turnover, whichever is higher.

- ## 2024-2025: From Theoretical Frameworks to Operational Reality

  The years 2024 and 2025 witnessed AI risk transition from predominantly theoretical concern to operational reality, as high-profile failures demonstrated the inadequacy of existing risk management practices, whilst simultaneously driving rapid adoption of risk frameworks, dramatic surges in cybersecurity threats, and the proliferation of model drift undermining production systems.

  ### Catastrophic Real-World Failures

  2024-2025 exposed significant gaps between risk management frameworks and operational practice through high-profile incidents that demonstrated technical risk management was insufficient without addressing operational processes, employee training, and legal accountability structures.

  **Samsung Engineering Data Breach (2023, lessons learned 2024):** Engineers used ChatGPT to debug code, inadvertently pasting sensitive semiconductor designs and proprietary data into the chat interface across three separate incidents. The engineers failed to appreciate that inputs could be used to train future models, resulting in intellectual property leakage. This incident catalysed enterprise policies prohibiting use of public AI systems for sensitive data.

  **Air Canada Chatbot Liability Case (2024):** An Air Canada chatbot promised a bereavement discount to a customer. The airline refused to honour the commitment, arguing in court that the chatbot was a separate legal entity. The court rejected this defence, holding Air Canada accountable for its chatbot's representations, establishing precedent that organisations cannot disclaim responsibility for AI agent actions.

  ### Security Threat Explosion

  AI-powered cyberattacks surged dramatically in 2024-2025. Projections indicated a 50% increase in AI-driven attacks in 2024 compared to 2021, with 93% of security leaders expecting their organisations to face daily AI-driven attacks by 2025.

  Prompt injection attacks—whereby malicious inputs manipulate AI systems into performing unintended actions—emerged as the top LLM security risk according to the OWASP Top 10 for LLMs in 2025. Attackers exploited prompt injection to extract training data, bypass content filters, and gain unauthorized access to integrated systems.

  Adversarial attacks demonstrated universal vulnerability: even state-of-the-art models remained susceptible to carefully crafted inputs designed to induce misclassification. The 2024 AI Safety Index found that all flagship models were vulnerable to adversarial attacks, revealing fundamental architectural limitations.

  ### Emerging Risk Categories

  2024-2025 identified novel risk categories absent from earlier frameworks:

	- #### Supply Chain Risks
	  Foundation models developed by third parties introduced dependency risks whereby upstream model vulnerabilities affected countless downstream applications. When a foundation model exhibited bias or security flaws, all fine-tuned derivatives inherited those risks.

	- #### Compounding Risks
	  AI systems increasingly operated in multi-agent environments where risks compounded unpredictably. For instance, multiple trading algorithms interacting created flash crash risks exceeding any single system's design parameters.

	- #### Value Alignment Risks
	  As AI systems gained autonomy, ensuring alignment with human values and intentions became critical. Specification gaming—whereby systems technically satisfy stated objectives whilst violating intent—demonstrated the difficulty of robust value alignment.

  ### Risk Quantification Challenges

  Organizations struggled to quantify AI risk in financially meaningful terms required for board-level decision-making and insurance underwriting. Unlike traditional IT risks with established actuarial models, AI risks lacked historical data, making probability and impact estimation speculative. Only 12% of companies felt "very prepared" to assess, manage, and recover from AI risks in 2024-2025 surveys, whilst 75% lacked dedicated plans for generative AI risks specifically.

- ## AI-Generated Content and Misinformation Risks

  ### The Evolution of AI-Generated Fake News (2023-2025)

  **[Updated 2025]** The Guardian's 2023 warnings about [[AI-Generated Content]] risks have been validated and expanded upon in 2024-2025. Large language models can rapidly produce plausible-sounding but entirely fictitious news articles, blurring the line between credible information and misinformation. Malicious actors or even careless users can mislead the public by leveraging AI's ability to fabricate realistic content.

  Academic publishing has experienced a surge in AI-generated, error-riddled papers, with more than 10,000 papers retracted in 2023 alone—many due to AI-driven misconduct or mistakes. Hidden prompts have been used to manipulate automated review systems, representing a new form of academic dishonesty.

  ### Knowledge Fossilization Crisis

  Current research warns of a "knowledge crisis" where AI-generated errors and fake content become entrenched in the scientific record and are propagated when future AI models are trained on polluted datasets. This undermines epistemic trust and poses long-term risks to knowledge creation.

  Scholars warn that errors created by AI models are likely to become hard-coded into digital knowledge repositories, affecting future research unless systemic interventions are adopted to identify and purge "AI fossilized" mistakes.

  ### Public Perception and Election Misinformation

  The spread of AI-facilitated fake news in political contexts has heightened public anxiety, especially during events like the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election. Concern is driven more by exposure to AI-related news than by direct use or awareness of AI tools. This disconnect suggests that media narratives about AI "supercharging" misinformation carry significant weight in shaping public concerns.

  ### Model Safety Degradation

  **[Updated 2025]** Newer, more conversational models such as ChatGPT-5 are demonstrably more likely to produce unsafe or harmful content compared to their predecessors, despite corporate claims of improved safety. This includes responses facilitating risky behaviours or enabling dependency in vulnerable users. Large model updates have increased rather than reduced the frequency of harmful outputs, raising new challenges for both technical AI alignment and regulatory oversight.

- ## Jaron Lanier's Perspective: AI-Driven Insanity Risk

  **[Updated 2025]** Technology philosopher Jaron Lanier argues that the most pressing risk posed by artificial intelligence is not its potential to destroy humanity, but rather its capacity to disrupt human sanity, social coherence, and mutual understanding. He frames AI not as an independent, malevolent superintelligence but as an amplification tool that intensifies existing social and psychological vulnerabilities.

  ### AI as a Distorter of Human Relations

  Lanier contends that AI technologies threaten to make people "mutually unintelligible" and potentially "insane" by distorting communication, fragmenting reality, and deepening social divides. The primary concern is not catastrophic scenarios but the gradual erosion of shared reality through algorithmically tailored experiences, such as personalized news feeds and [[Deepfakes]], which foster confusion and alienation.

  ### Amplification of Bias and Mental Health Impacts

  AI is not neutral—it encodes and amplifies biases present in the data and those of its developers, leading to entrenched social injustices in lending, policing, and hiring. Lanier highlights consequences for mental health, especially among vulnerable populations like teenagers who are susceptible to anxiety and social comparison through algorithm-driven platforms.

  ### AI as Corporate Power Tool

  In Lanier's view, AI's greatest immediate risk is as a "superpowered exoskeleton" for existing power structures—especially corporations and institutions—to manipulate people at scale. He draws parallels between corporations (non-human entities with real-world agency) and AI, underscoring how agency misaligned with broad human interests continues.

  ### Reality Fragmentation

  Lanier postulates scenarios where AI enables individuals to live in customised informational "bubbles" or realities, further undermining collective understanding and civic discourse. He warns of a potential future where AI not only mediates all social exchanges but may even replace direct communication between humans in trivial and meaningful interactions alike.

- ## Economic and Employment Impact

  ### 2024-2025 Job Automation Statistics

  **[Updated 2025]** Recent research and authoritative forecasts from 2024-2025 estimate that up to 30% of current jobs in advanced economies are at risk of automation by artificial intelligence by the early 2030s, with sectoral impacts and net job creation offsetting losses in some areas. These figures replace outdated estimates such as Frey & Osborne (2017).

  #### Global Job Risk Assessment

	- Approximately 9.1% of jobs worldwide (300 million jobs) could be lost to AI by 2030
	- Around 30% of current U.S. jobs (~50 million, primarily entry-level) could be automated by 2030
	- 60% of jobs will have tasks significantly modified by AI rather than fully automated
	- AI could displace 92 million jobs globally but simultaneously create 170 million new jobs (e.g., AI specialists, autonomous vehicle engineers, big data analysts), for a net gain of 78 million

  #### Sectoral Breakdown (2025-2030 Projections)

	- **High Risk Sectors:**
		- Administrative roles (assistants, secretaries): 6 million+ job losses
		- Cashiers, ticket clerks: 12 million+ losses
		- Customer service, call centre agents, telemarketers: rapid decline, replaced by chatbots
		- Accounting, bookkeeping, payroll clerks: 1.5 million+ losses
		- Medical transcriptionists: 4.7% employment decline projected
		- Cleaning and caretaker roles: 2.5 million+ losses

	- **Growth Sectors:**
		- Software developers: 17.9% employment increase projected
		- Big data and AI specialists: steepest job growth, fastest-growing titles
		- AI-fluent managers and technical specialists
		- Autonomous vehicle engineers and AI product managers

  #### Economic Impact Projections

	- Banks could see 50% productivity boost and 15 percentage point efficiency increase due to AI
	- In AI-exposed industries, revenue per worker and wages rising 2x-3x faster than in less-exposed sectors
	- 56% wage premium for AI skills (PwC 2025 Jobs Barometer)
	- AI chip revenue will surpass $92 billion in 2025

  #### Industry Adoption

  **[Updated 2025]** Approximately 78% of companies report integrating generative AI into their operations according to McKinsey's 2025 Global Survey, intensifying the need for robust AI risk management.

  ### The Case for Concern and Counter-Arguments

  The impact of job losses will be uneven, with some industries and regions hit harder than others, exacerbating existing inequalities. Low-skill and routine jobs are most at risk of automation, which could widen the gap between high- and low-income earners. Without adequate social safety nets and support for displaced workers, there is risk of social unrest and political backlash against AI and automation.

  However, economist David Autor from MIT presents a compelling counterargument in his analysis "AI Could Actually Help Rebuild The Middle Class." Autor posits that AI has potential to democratize expertise and create new opportunities for workers without advanced degrees, ultimately leading to greater equity and a stronger middle class. Unlike past automation technologies, AI can learn from unstructured data and tacit knowledge, enabling it to augment human capabilities in complex decision-making domains. By providing real-time guidance and guardrails, AI can expand access to expertise and allow people with less formal training to perform higher-skilled work.

- ## AI Safety and Existential Risk

  ### International AI Safety Report 2025

  **[Updated 2025]** The International AI Safety Report 2025, commissioned by 30 nations plus the UN, EU, and OECD, was published in January 2025 as the first comprehensive, global synthesis of scientific evidence on the capabilities, risks, and safety of advanced general-purpose AI.

  The Report highlighted concrete harms from current AI systems including privacy violations, AI-enabled scams, unreliable outputs leading to malfunctions, and creation of harmful deepfake content (especially sexualized deepfakes posing risks to women and children). More severe risks identified include the potential use of advanced AI for cyberweapons, biothreats, and loss of control over increasingly autonomous AI systems.

  The October 2025 First Key Update reported accelerated AI progress, with new capabilities in mathematics, coding, and science further increasing risks in cybersecurity and biosecurity, challenging monitoring, and raising global security concerns.

  ### Alignment Challenges

  Core technical alignment challenges highlighted in recent research include:

	- **Goal misgeneralization:** AI behaviour diverging from intended objectives during deployment
	- **Robustness:** Vulnerability against adversarial prompts or environmental changes
	- **Transparency and interpretability:** Difficulty reliably understanding complex, opaque models
	- **Scalable oversight:** Challenges as AI capabilities exceed human expertise in narrow domains

  Despite major advances in controllability, reports emphasise that no current method offers guaranteed prevention of catastrophic misalignment or misuse in frontier AI systems.

  ### UK AI Safety Institute and International Collaboration

  The UK [[AI Safety Institute]] played a central role in drafting the International AI Safety Report and initiating large-scale model evaluations including red-teaming and standardised risk benchmarks. Increased coordination between research, policy, and public communication was recommended, highlighting a new era of international, evidence-based governance.

  The Future of Life Institute's AI Safety Index (2025) assessed seven leading companies on 33 measures, finding progress but widespread gaps between public safety commitments and deployed safeguards, especially for extreme risks and open-weight models.

  ### Expert Consensus Evolution

  The International AI Safety Report 2025 foregrounds both consensus and dissent among global experts: there remains no unified estimate of existential risk from AI, but compared to earlier years, there is greater acknowledgment of plausible catastrophic and even existential tail risks.

  Increasingly, authoritative voices call for greater public accountability, transparency from AI developers, and proactive investment in technical and policy research to reduce the spectrum of catastrophic outcomes. Persistent gaps exist between AI company safety claims and external, independent evaluations of model security, alignment, and robustness against misuse.

- ## Risk Management Frameworks and Best Practices

  ### NIST AI Risk Management Framework

  The NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0) provides a voluntary framework designed to help organizations manage AI-related risks through four core functions:

	- **GOVERN:** Establish and maintain governance structures, policies, and processes
	- **MAP:** Identify and document AI system context, risks, and impacts
	- **MEASURE:** Analyse, assess, and track identified risks
	- **MANAGE:** Allocate resources, implement responses, and monitor effectiveness

  ### ISO/IEC 23894:2023 Implementation

  Organisations implementing ISO 23894:2023 discovered that effective AI risk management required cross-functional collaboration between data scientists, security professionals, legal counsel, and business leaders—a cultural shift from siloed technical risk management. The standard adapts traditional risk management practices to AI's unique characteristics including opacity, complexity, autonomy, and data dependency.

  ### Council of Europe HUDERIA Guidance

  The Council of Europe developed the HUDERIA (Human Rights, Democracy, and Rule of Law Impact Assessment) guidance for assessing the human rights, democracy, and rule of law impacts of AI systems, providing a complementary framework to technical risk assessments.

  ### Best Practices

	- **Systematic Risk Identification:** Use structured frameworks (NIST AI RMF, ISO 23894, EU AI Act requirements)
	- **Continuous Risk Monitoring:** Risks evolve over time requiring ongoing assessment and model drift detection
	- **Stakeholder Engagement:** Include affected parties in risk assessment processes
	- **Context-Specific Analysis:** Risks vary by domain, application, and deployment context
	- **Documentation and Communication:** Maintain comprehensive risk registers and communicate transparently to stakeholders
	- **Independent Auditing:** Third-party evaluation essential to address information asymmetries
	- **Incident Reporting:** Participate in AI incident databases to enable systemic learning

- ## EU AI Act Implementation and Compliance

  ### Risk-Based Regulatory Framework

  **[Updated 2025]** The EU AI Act's risk-based framework categorises AI systems as unacceptable, high, limited, or minimal risk, establishing requirements proportionate to risk level. Implementation proceeds on schedule with no delays:

  #### Compliance Timeline

	- **February 2, 2025:** Prohibited AI practices effective (biometric categorization based on sensitive traits, emotion recognition in workplaces, manipulative systems, social scoring)
	- **May 2, 2025:** Codes of Practice published including GPAI code
	- **August 2, 2025:** Major provisions apply including notified bodies, GPAI models, governance structures, and penalty regimes. Member States must designate competent authorities
	- **August 2, 2026:** Full rules for high-risk AI systems and transparency obligations take effect. Member States must have at least one regulatory sandbox operational
	- **August 2, 2027:** GPAI models placed on market before August 2, 2025 must be compliant
	- **December 31, 2030:** Final deadline for legacy large-scale IT AI systems compliance

  ### High-Risk AI System Requirements

  High-risk systems include those used in critical sectors such as recruitment, medical devices, law enforcement, education, and critical infrastructure. Provider obligations include:

	- Extensive risk and quality management systems
	- Data quality, governance, and minimization of bias
	- Comprehensive technical documentation
	- Human oversight mechanisms
	- Robust post-market monitoring and incident reporting
	- Transparency and labelling requirements

  ### Enforcement and Penalties

	- Fines can reach up to €35 million or 7% of total worldwide annual turnover, whichever is higher
	- National competent authorities (notifying and market surveillance) designated by August 2, 2025
	- European Commission and AI Office provide EU-level oversight
	- Regulatory sandboxes enable testing and refining compliance approaches

  ### Incident Reporting Requirements

  **[Updated 2025]** The EU AI Act mandates serious incident reporting within 15 days for high-risk systems causing death, serious health damage, or fundamental rights violations. This created AI incident databases providing unprecedented visibility into failure modes. Analysis of reported incidents revealed patterns: bias incidents (employment discrimination, credit denial) dominated reports, followed by security vulnerabilities (prompt injection, model extraction), safety failures (autonomous systems, robotics), and privacy breaches.

- ## Disallowed Uses and Prohibited Practices

  ### OpenAI Usage Policies

  Major AI providers including [[OpenAI]] prohibit use of their models, tools, and services for:

	- Illegal activity of any kind
	- Child Sexual Abuse Material or content exploiting or harming children

	- Emotion recognition in workplace and educational institutions
	- Social scoring systems for general purposes by public authorities
	- Manipulative or exploitative AI systems
	- Real-time remote biometric identification in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement (with limited exceptions)

- ## Education and AI Risk

  ### AI in Educational Settings

  **[Updated 2025]** Harvard Business School research on AI prompting templates for teaching tasks highlights both opportunities and risks in educational AI deployment. AI prompting templates serve as reusable frameworks for educators to efficiently design lesson plans, quizzes, and assignments using generative AI, streamlining instructional design while maintaining consistency.

  #### Benefits and Applications

	- Drafting lesson plans with automated structure encoding preferred teaching styles
	- Creating quizzes and assessments rapidly with adjustable difficulty and format
	- Simulating classroom roles (guest expert, peer, feedback provider)
	- Increasing efficiency allowing faculty to focus on high-impact teaching
	- Providing personalized, individualized feedback supporting differentiated instruction

  #### Associated Risks

	- **Reliability and accuracy:** AI's probabilistic nature means hallucinations and errors remain possible
	- **Ethical concerns:** Templates must prompt debate around bias, privacy, and academic honesty
	- **Over-reliance:** Risk of diminishing human creativity and oversight
	- **Transparency requirements:** Educators must interrogate outputs and annotate AI-generated materials for errors

  ### Educational AI Impact Study

  Randomized controlled trial of students using GPT-4 as a tutor in Nigeria showed 6 weeks of after-school AI tutoring equaled 2 years of typical learning gains, outperforming 80% of other educational interventions. The intervention helped all students, especially girls who were initially behind. However, concerns persist about over-reliance potentially hindering development of essential skills like problem-solving and critical analysis.

- ## Sector-Specific Risks

	- Regulatory compliance challenges (FDA, HIPAA, medical device regulations)

  ### Financial Services AI Risks

	- Discriminatory lending or credit decisions violating fair lending laws
	- Market manipulation through algorithmic trading
	- Flash crashes from compounding algorithmic risks
	- Fraud and financial crime facilitation
	- Regulatory compliance (SEC, FINRA, banking regulations)

  ### Employment and HR AI Risks

	- Discriminatory hiring, promotion, or termination decisions
	- Privacy violations in candidate assessment and employee monitoring
	- Lack of transparency in automated employment decisions
	- Compliance with equal employment opportunity regulations
	- Bias amplification in performance evaluation systems

  ### Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice AI Risks

	- Biased risk assessment tools affecting bail, sentencing, and parole decisions
	- Facial recognition errors leading to wrongful arrests
	- Predictive policing reinforcing historical biases
	- Due process violations through opaque algorithmic decision-making
	- Disproportionate impact on marginalized communities

- ## Key Issues and Tensions

  The AI risk landscape involves fundamental tensions and unresolved questions:

	- How much risk does advanced AI development pose? Is it an existential threat to humanity?
	- Do the potential benefits of faster AI progress outweigh the risks?
	- How tractable are proposals for making advanced AI systems safe and aligned with human values?
	- To what extent should governments regulate or restrict AI development versus leaving it to industry?
	- Will AI liberate humanity or lead to greater inequality, less human agency, and new dangers?
	- What moral philosophy should guide these decisions: utilitarianism, human-centric values, or an AI-centric ethic?
	- How do we balance innovation imperatives against potential catastrophic failures?
