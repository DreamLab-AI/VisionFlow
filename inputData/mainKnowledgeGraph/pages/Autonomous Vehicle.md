## Autonomous Vehicle

Autonomous Vehicle refers to an autonomous vehicle is a self-driving vehicle capable of navigating and operating without human intervention, employing artificial intelligence for perception, localisation, path planning, motion control, and decision-making. autonomous vehicles integrate sensor fusion, computer vision, deep learning, and control algorithms to achieve sae automation levels ranging from level 1 (driver assistance) to level 5 (full automation).

- Industry adoption of AVs remains progressive but cautious, with SAE automation levels ranging from Level 1 (driver assistance) to Level 5 (full automation) still under active development and testing.
  - Notable organisations include Waymo, Tesla, Aurora, and various automotive manufacturers advancing AV technologies.
  - Connected vehicle technology has become widespread, with approximately 75% of new vehicles equipped with connectivity features enabling vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication.
  - Technical capabilities now include advanced sensor fusion, deep learning for perception, and AI-driven decision-making; however, limitations persist in handling complex urban environments and unpredictable scenarios.
  - Regulatory frameworks are evolving, with agencies such as the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) prioritising safety, innovation, and commercial deployment, including augmented reality testing methods for AV performance.
  - Standards and frameworks continue to develop globally, emphasising safety, interoperability, and cybersecurity.
