## Model Depth

Model Depth refers to the number of transformer layers (encoder and/or decoder) stacked in a model, determining the number of sequential transformations applied to representations.

- Industry adoption and implementations
	- Leading platforms such as Hugging Face, Google DeepMind, and Meta AI routinely deploy models with variable depth, often exceeding 100 layers for large language and diffusion models
	- In the UK, companies like DeepMind (London), Faculty (London), and Inflection AI (Cambridge) leverage deep transformer architectures for research and commercial applications
	- North England has seen growing adoption in academic and industrial settings, with institutions in Manchester, Leeds, and Newcastle integrating deep models into research on healthcare, climate science, and smart cities
- Technical capabilities and limitations
	- Increased depth generally improves representational power, but also raises computational costs and training complexity
	- Very deep models may require advanced optimisation techniques (e.g., gradient checkpointing, residual connections) to train effectively
	- There is ongoing debate about the optimal depth for specific tasks, with some domains benefiting more from width than depth
- Standards and frameworks
	- Modern deep learning frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX) provide flexible APIs for specifying and training models of arbitrary depth
	- Best practices for depth selection are guided by empirical benchmarks and theoretical scaling laws
