- ## About Blockchain Interoperability
	- Cross-chain communication protocols and infrastructure enabling seamless data, asset, and smart contract interactions across heterogeneous blockchain networks. These solutions address the fragmentation of blockchain ecosystems—where 150+ production blockchains operate in isolation—through bridges, relays, atomic swaps, wrapped tokens, and unified interoperability standards. Major protocols include Polkadot's parachain architecture connecting 100+ specialised chains, Cosmos IBC facilitating 50+ sovereign blockchain communications, Chainlink CCIP providing secure cross-chain messaging for enterprise applications, and Hyperledger Cactus enabling private-public chain integration for supply chain consortia. Whilst interoperability unlocks £180+ billion in cross-chain value transfer annually, the sector faces critical security challenges with £2.6 billion lost to bridge exploits (2021-2023), driving evolution towards trust-minimised protocols, zero-knowledge proofs, and consensus-layer interoperability for the vision of a truly interconnected blockchain internet.

			- 150+ production blockchain networks operating in isolation (Ethereum, Bitcoin, Polkadot, Cosmos, Solana, etc.)
			- £2.4 trillion total cryptocurrency market cap fragmented across incompatible chains
			- 45+ layer-2 scaling solutions further fragmenting Ethereum ecosystem alone
			- Enterprise adoption: 80% of supply chain consortia using multiple blockchains (Hyperledger Fabric, Ethereum, Corda)
			- Developer burden: rebuilding applications for each blockchain (£500K-2M per platform port)
			- User friction: separate wallets, bridges, and interfaces for each ecosystem
			- Liquidity fragmentation: £180 billion in assets locked across isolated DeFi protocols
		- **Interoperability Requirements**
			- Data portability: sharing supply chain provenance across manufacturer, logistics, retail blockchains
			- Asset transfer: moving tokenised assets (NFTs, securities, loyalty points) between chains
			- Smart contract interaction: cross-chain automated workflows (payment on one chain triggering shipment verification on another)
			- Identity federation: self-sovereign identity credentials recognised across multiple networks
			- Regulatory compliance: sharing KYC/AML data across financial blockchain networks
			- Oracle integration: real-world data feeds accessible to multiple blockchain applications
			- Scalability: distributing transaction load across complementary networks (high-throughput and high-security chains)
		- **Traditional Integration Limitations**
			- Centralised exchanges: custodial risk and regulatory bottlenecks for cross-chain asset movement
			- Wrapped tokens: centralised custodians holding £65 billion (WBTC, renBTC) creating single points of failure
			- Notary schemes: trusted intermediaries contradicting blockchain decentralisation principles
			- Hash time-locked contracts: limited to simple asset swaps, not complex data or smart contract interactions
			- Compatibility barriers: fundamentally different consensus mechanisms, virtual machines, data models preventing direct communication
		- **Security and Trust Challenges**
			- Bridge exploits: £2.6 billion stolen from cross-chain bridges (2021-2023), representing 65% of DeFi hacks
			- Validator compromise: multi-signature bridges requiring only 2-of-5 or 3-of-9 validator consensus (Ronin Bridge: £625 million hack)
			- Smart contract vulnerabilities: cross-chain message verification bugs enabling replay attacks
			- Economic security: bridges securing £30 billion with only £200 million in staked collateral
			- Centralisation risks: 70% of cross-chain volume flowing through 5 centralised platforms
