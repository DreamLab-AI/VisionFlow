- ## Overview
	- [[Runes and Glyphs]] represent next-generation [[fungible token]] standards built on [[Bitcoin]]'s [[Layer 1]] [[blockchain]], enabling efficient creation and transfer of [[digital assets]] without requiring [[sidechains]] or additional consensus layers
	- **Runes Protocol**: Created by [[Casey Rodarmor]] (creator of [[Ordinals]]), launched April 2024 at [[Bitcoin]] [[halving]] [[block height]] 840,000, designed as native [[UTXO]]-based [[fungible token]] standard
	- **Glyphs Protocol**: Developed by [[Melvin Carvalho]], complementary protocol exploring alternative approaches to Bitcoin-native token issuance and management
	- Both protocols emerged from limitations and inefficiencies of earlier [[BRC-20]] standard, which relied on [[Ordinals]] [[inscriptions]] and created significant [[blockchain bloat]]
	- Represent fundamental shift toward [[UTXO]] efficiency in Bitcoin [[token economics]], aligning with Bitcoin's native transaction model rather than forcing account-based semantics
	- [Updated 2025] Runes has processed over $2.1 billion in cumulative trading volume with 15,000+ unique token deployments across major [[exchanges]] and [[decentralized platforms]]

- ## Runes Protocol: Technical Architecture

- ### Origins and Design Philosophy
	- Created by [[Casey Rodarmor]] in response to [[BRC-20]]'s inefficient use of Bitcoin [[blockspace]], which stored token state in [[Ordinals]] [[inscription]] [[metadata]]
	- Announced in September 2023 via [[Bitcoin]] improvement proposal discussions, officially launched April 20, 2024 coinciding with fourth Bitcoin [[halving]]
	- Design goals: [[UTXO]]-native implementation, minimal [[blockchain]] footprint, no dependency on off-chain indexers for basic functionality, compatibility with [[Lightning Network]]
	- Philosophy emphasises Bitcoin's [[UTXO]] model as superior foundation for [[fungible tokens]] compared to account-based approaches borrowed from [[Ethereum]]
	- Intentionally simple specification to minimise [[consensus]] risks and maintain Bitcoin's [[security]] guarantees without requiring [[soft fork]] or [[hard fork]]
	- Built on Bitcoin's existing [[OP_RETURN]] [[opcode]] functionality, ensuring compatibility with all Bitcoin [[nodes]] without protocol changes

- ### Core Technical Mechanisms
	- **[[OP_RETURN]] Storage**: Runes uses [[OP_RETURN]] outputs to store protocol messages, allowing up to 80 bytes of arbitrary data per [[transaction]]
	- **Runestone Structure**: Each Runes transaction contains a "runestone" - protocol message encoded in [[OP_RETURN]] specifying token operations (mint, transfer, burn)
	- **[[UTXO]]-Based Balances**: Token balances stored directly in Bitcoin [[UTXOs]], each UTXO can carry multiple Runes simultaneously
	- **Protocol Buffers Encoding**: Uses efficient [[varint]] encoding scheme to minimise data size, critical given [[OP_RETURN]]'s 80-byte limitation
	- **Edicts System**: Transactions contain "edicts" specifying how Runes transfer between [[inputs]] and [[outputs]], deterministically processing token flows
	- **Cenotaph Mechanism**: Invalid Runes transactions marked as "cenotaphs" - protocol errors that burn tokens to prevent accidental loss through malformed transactions

- ### Transaction Flow and Processing
	- Runes [[minting]]: Deployment transaction creates new Rune with parameters (name, symbol, supply, divisibility), stored in [[OP_RETURN]]
	- Name encoding uses [[base26]] alphabet with bullet separator (•), creating distinctive names like "UNCOMMON•GOODS" or "DOG•GO•TO•THE•MOON"
	- **Etching**: Initial deployment of Rune defines total supply, divisibility (0-38 decimal places), mint terms (open mint vs premine), and transfer rules
	- **Transfer mechanism**: Standard Bitcoin transactions with Runestone in [[OP_RETURN]] specifying which Runes move to which outputs
	- **Batch operations**: Single transaction can transfer multiple different Runes simultaneously, significantly more efficient than [[BRC-20]] which required separate transactions per token
	- **[[Indexer]] requirements**: While protocol is [[UTXO]]-native, practical wallets and explorers run indexers to track Runes across [[blockchain]] history

- ### Advanced Protocol Features
	- **Divisibility control**: Tokens support 0-38 decimal places, enabling everything from whole-number NFTs to micro-payments
	- **Supply caps**: Hard caps on maximum supply enforced at protocol level, preventing inflation beyond initial parameters
	- **Mint terms**: Flexible minting - closed (premine), open (anyone can mint until cap), or time-limited open mints
	- **Burning mechanism**: Explicit burn operations reduce circulating supply, useful for [[deflationary]] [[tokenomics]]
	- **[[Lightning Network]] compatibility**: [[UTXO]]-based design enables future [[Layer 2]] integration, potentially allowing Runes in [[Lightning]] channels
	- **[[Atomic swaps]]**: Native support for trustless cross-Rune swaps within single Bitcoin transaction, foundation for [[decentralized exchange]] functionality

- ## Glyphs Protocol: Alternative Approach

- ### Protocol Overview
	- Developed by [[Melvin Carvalho]], prominent Bitcoin developer and [[Nostr]] protocol contributor
	- Explores alternative encoding schemes and token management approaches complementary to Runes
	- Focused on experimental features and community-driven token standards on Bitcoin [[testnet]]
	- Emphasises compatibility with [[decentralized identity]] systems and [[Nostr]] [[social networks]]
	- Provides testing ground for innovations before potential [[mainnet]] deployment

- ### Technical Implementation
	- Uses similar [[OP_RETURN]]-based messaging but with different encoding schemes optimised for specific use cases
	- Integration with [[Nostr]] protocol for [[decentralized]] token metadata and [[social]] features
	- Testnet-first approach allows rapid iteration without risking real Bitcoin value
	- Explores [[NFT]]-like properties within [[fungible token]] framework - hybrid token models
	- Community governance features enabling token holder voting on protocol parameters

- ### Relationship to Runes
	- Both protocols share [[UTXO]]-native philosophy, departing from [[Ordinals]]/[[BRC-20]] inscription model
	- Glyphs serves as experimental laboratory for features that may influence Runes development
	- Cross-compatible indexing infrastructure - many tools support both protocols
	- Complementary rather than competitive - different use cases and risk profiles
	- Glyphs more experimental, Runes more production-focused with larger ecosystem

- ## Deep Dive: OP_RETURN and UTXO Architecture

- ### OP_RETURN Mechanism
	- [[OP_RETURN]] is Bitcoin [[opcode]] that marks [[transaction]] [[output]] as provably unspendable, allowing arbitrary data storage
	- Originally limited to 40 bytes, increased to 80 bytes in 2015 after community consensus
	- Enables "colored coins" concept - associating metadata with specific [[UTXOs]] to represent assets
	- Runes optimises 80-byte limit through clever encoding: protocol identifier (0x52) + compressed [[varint]] messages
	- Critical advantage: [[OP_RETURN]] outputs prunable by [[nodes]] running pruned mode, reducing long-term storage burden compared to [[witness]] data
	- Does not bloat [[UTXO set]] since [[OP_RETURN]] outputs immediately unspendable, unlike [[Ordinals]] which create spend-able outputs carrying data

- ### UTXO Model Integration
	- Bitcoin's [[UTXO]] (Unspent Transaction Output) model tracks discrete "coins" rather than account balances
	- Each [[UTXO]] in Runes can carry multiple token types simultaneously - "multiplexing" different Runes on same output
	- Token transfers follow Bitcoin's [[transaction]] flow: consume input UTXOs, create output UTXOs with new token distributions
	- **Key efficiency**: Consolidating multiple token transfers in single transaction amortizes Bitcoin [[transaction fees]]
	- [[Coin selection]] algorithms extended to optimise both Bitcoin and Runes balances simultaneously
	- [[Privacy]] implications: Similar to Bitcoin UTXOs, Runes transfers can be analysed on-chain, but [[CoinJoin]] techniques applicable

- ### Comparison: UTXO vs Account Model
	- Account-based tokens ([[Ethereum]] [[ERC-20]]) maintain global state mapping addresses to balances
	- [[UTXO]]-based tokens (Runes) distribute state across individual transaction outputs
	- **Parallelism**: [[UTXO]] model enables better transaction parallelization - non-overlapping UTXOs process concurrently
	- **State bloat**: Account models accumulate state indefinitely, [[UTXO]] models only track unspent outputs
	- **[[Smart contract]] complexity**: Account models easier for complex [[DeFi]], [[UTXO]] models simpler and more auditable
	- Runes embraces Bitcoin's [[UTXO]] philosophy rather than forcing account semantics through [[Ordinals]] inscriptions

- ## Comparative Analysis: Bitcoin Token Standards

- ### Runes vs Ordinals
	- [[Ordinals]]: Theory assigning unique identifiers to individual [[satoshis]], enabling [[NFT]]-like collectibles on Bitcoin
	- [[Ordinals]] creates [[non-fungible]] assets by inscribing data in [[witness]] field of [[Taproot]] transactions
	- Runes explicitly designed for [[fungible tokens]], Ordinals for unique digital artefacts
	- **Storage location**: Ordinals uses [[witness]] data (bloats [[blockchain]] permanently), Runes uses [[OP_RETURN]] (prunable)
	- **Use case overlap**: Some projects launched as Ordinals collections, then issued Runes tokens for community governance
	- Created by same developer ([[Casey Rodarmor]]), designed as complementary standards - Ordinals for [[NFTs]], Runes for [[fungible tokens]]
	- [Updated 2025] Many [[NFT]] projects now issue companion Runes tokens for [[utility]] and [[governance]]

- ### Runes vs BRC-20
	- [[BRC-20]]: Earlier [[fungible token]] standard built atop [[Ordinals]] protocol, launched March 2023
	- [[BRC-20]] stores token ledger as [[JSON]] inscriptions in [[Ordinals]], requiring off-chain indexers to track balances
	- **Efficiency crisis**: Each [[BRC-20]] transfer requires new inscription, consuming significant [[blockspace]] - single transfer can exceed 1 KB
	- Runes transfers typically 200-300 bytes including Bitcoin overhead, 70% reduction vs [[BRC-20]]
	- [[BRC-20]] triggered Bitcoin [[mempool]] congestion in May 2023, driving [[transaction fees]] to multi-year highs
	- **Indexer centralization**: [[BRC-20]] requires complex indexers parsing all [[Ordinals]] inscriptions, Runes indexing more straightforward
	- Market impact: Runes launched with goal to "replace [[BRC-20]]", offering superior technical design for same use cases
	- [Updated 2025] [[BRC-20]] volume declining 68% year-over-year as projects migrate to Runes for lower fees

- ### Runes vs Taproot Assets
	- [[Taproot Assets]]: Protocol by [[Lightning Labs]] for issuing assets on Bitcoin, leveraging [[Taproot]] [[Schnorr signatures]]
	- Stores asset data in [[Taproot]] [[script trees]], more private than [[OP_RETURN]] but more complex
	- **[[Lightning]] integration**: [[Taproot Assets]] designed for seamless [[Lightning Network]] compatibility from inception
	- Runes simpler specification, [[Taproot Assets]] more feature-rich but requires specialized wallet support
	- [[Taproot Assets]] supports both [[fungible]] and [[non-fungible]] assets in unified framework
	- **Privacy model**: [[Taproot Assets]] transactions indistinguishable from normal Bitcoin transactions, Runes visible via [[OP_RETURN]]
	- Different philosophies: Runes emphasises simplicity and UTXO-native design, [[Taproot Assets]] emphasises privacy and [[Layer 2]] scalability
	- [Updated 2025] [[Taproot Assets]] gaining traction for institutional [[stablecoins]], Runes dominates retail [[memecoin]] market

- ### Runes vs RGB Protocol
	- [[RGB Protocol]]: Client-side validation protocol for Bitcoin assets, pioneered by [[Giacomo Zucco]] and [[LNP/BP Standards Association]]
	- [[RGB]] stores asset state off-chain, using Bitcoin as commitment layer - radical departure from on-chain token models
	- **Scalability**: [[RGB]] theoretically unlimited throughput since validation happens off-chain, only commitments on Bitcoin
	- Complexity trade-off: [[RGB]] requires sophisticated client software and complex [[cryptographic]] proofs
	- Runes fully on-chain, simpler to implement and verify, but limited by Bitcoin's [[block size]]
	- **Use case divergence**: [[RGB]] targets enterprise asset issuance and high-frequency [[DeFi]], Runes targets community tokens and [[NFT]] ecosystems
	- [[RGB]] leverages [[Lightning Network]] for instant transfers, Runes currently limited to Bitcoin [[block time]]
	- [Updated 2025] [[RGB]] seeing adoption for [[security tokens]] and [[stablecoins]] requiring regulatory compliance

	- **[[Amount]] privacy**: Unlike [[Confidential Transactions]], Runes amounts fully visible, trade-off for simplicity
	- Analysis resistance: [[Clustering]] algorithms and [[heuristics]] from Bitcoin [[privacy]] research applicable to Runes

- ## Challenges and Limitations

- ### Scalability Constraints
	- **Bitcoin [[block size]]**: 4 MB [[weight]] limit constrains maximum Runes throughput
	- [[Block time]]: 10-minute average means slower confirmation than [[Ethereum]] or [[Solana]]
	- **[[Fee market]] dynamics**: High Bitcoin [[mempool]] demand increases Runes transaction costs
	- [[Lightning]] dependency: Achieving high-frequency trading requires [[Layer 2]] solutions still in development
	- **[[Indexer]] sync time**: New users wait for full [[blockchain]] sync or trust external indexer services
	- Comparison: [[Ethereum]] processes 15-30 TPS, Bitcoin with Runes realistically 5-10 token transfers per second

- ### User Experience Hurdles
	- **Wallet fragmentation**: Not all Bitcoin wallets support Runes, users need specialized tools
	- [[Transaction fee]] estimation: Complex fee markets make predicting costs difficult for non-technical users
	- **[[UTXO]] management**: Users must understand [[coin selection]] and [[UTXO]] consolidation for optimal fees
	- [[Metadata]] limitations: [[OP_RETURN]]'s 80-byte limit restricts rich token descriptions
	- **Recovery complexity**: Seed phrases must support Bitcoin and Runes, recovery paths more complex
	- [Updated 2025] Wallet UX improving with abstracting [[UTXO]] complexity from end users

- ### Regulatory Uncertainty
	- **Securities classification**: Unclear whether Runes tokens qualify as [[securities]] under existing regulations
	- [[Tax]] treatment: Ambiguity around [[capital gains]], [[income tax]] for Runes [[mining]] or [[staking]]
	- **[[KYC]]/[[AML]]**: Centralized [[exchanges]] implementing compliance may restrict certain Runes
	- Geographic restrictions: Some jurisdictions may ban or restrict Runes trading
	- **[[Smart contract]] regulation**: Emerging [[DeFi]] regulations may impact Runes-based protocols
	- [Updated 2025] SEC has not issued specific guidance on Runes, creating compliance uncertainty
