- ### Custom models
	- AI/ML is the high interest rate credit card of product development
	- The likely emerging trend for [[Large language models]] is small models optimised for your data, with API collaboration and support from a big foundational model.
	- Think [[Mistral]], replacing one of the experts with YOUR expert
	- This is kinda true for image and video too, in that you can blend workflows between powerful online systems and more nuanced personal models. (imagebashing).
	- ### How to train models?
		- Smaller data and workflows:
			- Do it yourself with suitable cloud hardware. This applies to all Gen AI.
			- [[LoRA DoRA etc]] are very accessible. Basically nudge the existing models for your requirements.
			- Low legal peril.
		- Medium scale problems:
			- Own the skills you need for your data / product problem.
			- There's a lot of guidance from the major players like Microsoft
			  [Develop Generative AI solutions with Azure OpenAI Service
		- Training | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/develop-ai-solutions-azure-openai/)
			- Get in a private consultant like me and onboard the skills for your product / data problem
			- This is the same model a the hub and spokes needed for larger models
		- Large / complex product and data challenges:
			- The industry is set up around the necessary datacentres. These are centres of excellence, commercial labs, Universities, etc.
			- Engage commercial data team who get you up to speed and train your model on their hardware.
				- Salford Uni will doubtless have a strategy with Azure.

				- Hartree?
	- ### Roll out in the cloud.
	- Play with [Runpod](https://www.runpod.io/). There's some great [YouTube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjiX3lCnwUI)
	- I use a [Lambda Labs H100](https://lambdalabs.com/).
	- Unless you really know what you're doing, or you have a LOT of data, I wouldn't buy GPUs and attempt the inferencing side yourself

- [The paper introduces SAM-PT, an extension of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) that combines tracking and segmentation in dynamic videos. SAM-PT uses sparse point selection and propagation techniques to generate masks, achieving strong zero-shot performance on popular video object segmentation benchmarks. Unlike traditional object-centric mask propagation strategies, SAM-PT utilises point propagation to capture local structure information that is independent of object semantics. The paper also demonstrates the effectiveness of point-based tracking through evaluation on the Unidentified Video Objects (UVO) benchmark. To improve tracking accuracy, SAM-PT employs K-Medoids clustering for point initialization and tracks both positive and negative points to distinguish the target object. Additionally, multiple mask decoding passes and a point re-initialization strategy are used for mask refinement. The paper includes interactive video segmentation demos and showcases the results of SAM-PT on the DAVIS 2017 dataset, highlighting successful cases as well as failure cases. The effectiveness of SAM-PT is further demonstrated on avatar segmentation. The code and models for SAM-PT are available on GitHub. The paper concludes with a citation for reference.](http://www.vis.xyz/pub/sam-pt)

The model is trained to unify various segmentation tasks into a generalist in-context learning framework, and is evaluated on a broad range of tasks, including few-shot semantic segmentation, video object segmentation, semantic segmentation, and panoptic segmentation. Results show strong capabilities in segmenting in-domain and out-of-domain targets, either qualitatively or quantitatively.](https://buff.ly/3KD0Zns)
- Video-LLaMA is a project aimed at enhancing large language models (LLMs) with audio and visual understanding capabilities. It is built on top of BLIP-2 and MiniGPT-4 and consists of two core components: Vision-Language (VL) Branch and Audio-Language (AL) Branch. The VL Branch uses a two-layer video Q-Former and a frame embedding layer to compute video representations and is trained on the Webvid-2M video caption dataset with a video-to-text generation task, in addition to image-text pairs from LLaVA. The AL Branch, on the other hand, uses a two-layer audio Q-Former and an audio segment embedding layer to compute audio representations and is trained on video/image instrucaption data to connect the output of ImageBind to language decoder. The project provides pre-trained and fine-tuned checkpoints and users need to obtain them before using the repository. The repository also includes an example output and instructions on how to run the demo locally and how to perform the training. The project has been released under the BSD-3-Clause licence. https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/Video-LLaMA
