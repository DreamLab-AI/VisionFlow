## About Account Model

id:: account-model-about
Balance-based accounting model within blockchain systems providing essential functionality for distributed ledger technology operations and properties. The account model represents a departure from traditional UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) models, offering improved programmability and state management.

### Core Definition and Purpose

The account model is a blockchain architecture pattern where each participant maintains an account with a balance state. Unlike UTXO models that track individual unspent outputs, account models store cumulative balances for each address or account identifier. This enables:
- Direct balance queries without scanning entire transaction history
- Stateful smart contract execution
- Simplified transaction semantics
- Efficient state tree representation via Merkle Patricia Tries

### Key Characteristics

id:: account-model-characteristics
**1. Balance Tracking**
- Maintains persistent account state across blocks
- Real-time balance availability without computation
- Nonce/sequence numbers prevent replay attacks
**2. Nonce/Counter Mechanism**
- Sequential transaction counters per account
- Ensures transaction ordering and prevents double-spending
- Critical for transaction deduplication in asynchronous networks
**3. State Management**
- Accounts store multiple state fields (balance, nonce, code hash)
- Smart contract state persists across transactions
- Merkle tree structure enables efficient state verification
**4. Smart Contract Integration**
- Seamless contract deployment and execution
- Stateful contract storage enables DeFi applications
- Gas-based resource metering per transaction
**5. Scalability Tradeoffs**
- Larger state storage requirements vs UTXO
- State pruning and archival challenges
- Parallelization complexity due to account dependencies

### Technical Components

**Account Structure**
- Address: 20-byte (Ethereum) or 32-byte (Substrate) identifier
- Balance: Currency holdings in native units
