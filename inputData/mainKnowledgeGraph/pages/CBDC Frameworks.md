## CBDC Frameworks

CBDC Frameworks refers to a component of the blockchain ecosystem.

- Industry adoption and implementations
  - Over 130 countries are actively exploring or piloting CBDCs, covering 98% of global GDP
  - Early adopters include the Bahamas (Sand Dollar), Nigeria (eNaira), Jamaica (JAM-DEX), and Zimbabwe (ZiG)
  - Large-scale pilots are underway in China (e-CNY) and India (Digital Rupee)
  - Most G20 economies are in the pilot or development phase, with a focus on retail and wholesale applications
- Notable organisations and platforms
  - Central banks: People’s Bank of China, Reserve Bank of India, Bank of England, European Central Bank
  - Technology providers: R3 (Corda), ConsenSys, Ripple, and local fintechs in the UK
- UK and North England examples where relevant
  - The Bank of England has been conducting research and public consultations on a potential UK CBDC, with a focus on retail use cases
  - North England cities such as Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield are emerging as innovation hubs for fintech and digital finance
  - Local universities and research centres in these cities are collaborating with industry partners on CBDC-related projects, including digital identity and payment systems
- Technical capabilities and limitations
  - CBDCs can offer enhanced payment efficiency, financial inclusion, and programmability
  - Challenges include privacy concerns, scalability, interoperability, and the risk of disintermediating commercial banks
  - The choice of ledger technology (DLT vs. CLT) and access model (account-based vs. token-based) significantly impacts system performance and user experience
- Standards and frameworks
  - International standards are being developed by organisations such as the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
  - The BIS Innovation Hub and the IMF Virtual Handbook provide guidance on CBDC design and implementation
