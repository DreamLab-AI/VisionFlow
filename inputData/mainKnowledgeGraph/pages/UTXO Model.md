## UTXO Model

UTXO Model refers to unspent transaction output accounting model within blockchain systems, providing essential functionality for distributed ledger technology operations and properties.

- Industry adoption and implementations
	- Bitcoin remains the most prominent UTXO-based blockchain, with widespread global adoption
	- Cardano’s EUTXO model extends the original UTXO concept to support smart contracts and more complex logic
	- The Lightning Network, a second-layer scaling solution for Bitcoin, relies on UTXOs to enable off-chain transactions
- Notable organisations and platforms
	- OSL (Hong Kong-based, but with UK operations) provides institutional-grade Bitcoin trading and custody, leveraging UTXO-based security
	- Lightspark, a global infrastructure provider, uses the UTXO model to power instant, global payments via the Lightning Network
	- Kaleido, a blockchain platform, offers enterprise solutions that compare UTXO and account-based models for business use cases
- UK and North England examples where relevant
	- Several UK fintech firms, including those in Manchester and Leeds, are exploring UTXO-based solutions for secure, scalable payment systems
	- The University of Newcastle has research groups investigating blockchain scalability, with a focus on UTXO and EUTXO models
	- Sheffield-based startups are developing blockchain applications for supply chain management, leveraging the privacy and security benefits of UTXO
- Technical capabilities and limitations
	- The UTXO model allows for parallel transaction processing, enhancing scalability
	- It provides strong privacy guarantees, as each transaction output is a discrete unit
	- Limitations include complexity in managing multiple UTXOs and challenges in implementing certain types of smart contracts
- Standards and frameworks
	- The UTXO model is supported by various blockchain standards and frameworks, including those developed by the Blockchain Research Institute and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
