## Block Size

Block Size refers to data capacity limit of a block within blockchain systems, providing essential functionality for distributed ledger technology operations and properties.

- Industry adoption and implementations
	- Most major blockchains have moved beyond simple fixed block size limits
	- Bitcoin uses a block weight limit of 4 million weight units, allowing for a theoretical maximum block size of 4 MB, though practical sizes are typically around 2 MB
	- Ethereum employs a gas limit per block, dynamically adjusting the amount of computation and data that can be processed
	- Alternative blockchains such as Litecoin and Dogecoin have different block size and block time parameters to optimise for specific use cases
- Notable organisations and platforms
	- Bitstamp, Coinbase, and Yellow Card provide educational resources and trading platforms that reflect current block size practices
	- Academic and industry collaborations in the UK, including the University of Manchester and Leeds Beckett University, contribute to blockchain research and development
- UK and North England examples where relevant
	- The University of Manchester’s Blockchain Research Group explores scalability solutions, including block size optimisation
	- Leeds Beckett University’s Centre for Digital Innovation has projects focused on blockchain applications in supply chain and finance
	- Newcastle University’s School of Computing Science investigates the impact of block size on network performance and security
- Technical capabilities and limitations
	- Larger block sizes can increase transaction throughput but may lead to stales and temporary chain splits
	- Smaller block sizes enhance network resilience but can result in slower transaction processing and higher fees
	- Dynamic block size limits and weight-based systems offer a middle ground, balancing scalability and security
- Standards and frameworks
	- The Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) process governs changes to block size and other parameters
	- Ethereum’s EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) process similarly manages gas limit and block size adjustments
	- Industry standards such as the Blockchain Interoperability Alliance promote best practices for block size and other technical parameters
