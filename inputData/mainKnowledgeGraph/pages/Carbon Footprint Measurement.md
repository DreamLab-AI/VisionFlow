## Carbon Footprint Measurement

Carbon Footprint Measurement refers to a component of the blockchain ecosystem.

- Industry adoption of blockchain for carbon footprint measurement is growing, particularly within sustainable supply chains and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) reporting.
  - Organisations use blockchain to measure, report, and verify carbon emissions and offsets, ensuring data integrity and reducing fraud in carbon certification.
  - Notable platforms leverage private and consortium blockchains to balance transparency with data privacy, with cloud deployment dominating market share.
  - Blockchain enables transformation of carbon emissions data into tokenised carbon credits, facilitating trading and offsetting mechanisms.
- In the UK, and specifically North England, companies and innovation hubs are increasingly adopting blockchain-enabled sustainability solutions.
  - Cities such as Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield are fostering blockchain initiatives focused on environmental impact tracking and sustainable supply chains.
- Technical capabilities include:
  - Integration with IoT devices for accurate, real-time emissions data collection.
  - Immutable recording of carbon data to prevent manipulation.
  - Automated certification and compliance reporting.
- Limitations remain in scalability, energy consumption of some blockchain networks, and interoperability between different standards and platforms.
- Standards and frameworks guiding blockchain use in carbon footprint measurement include the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, EU MiCA sustainability reporting requirements, and emerging Blockchain Sustainability Frameworks developed by consultancies like PwC.
