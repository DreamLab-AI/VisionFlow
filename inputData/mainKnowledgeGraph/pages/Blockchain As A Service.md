## Blockchain As A Service

Blockchain As A Service refers to a component of the blockchain ecosystem.

- Industry adoption of BaaS continues to grow steadily, with the market value projected around USD 1.76 billion in 2025, expected to nearly double by 2030.
  - Major cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and IBM Cloud dominate the BaaS platform space, offering ready-to-use blockchain infrastructure.
  - BaaS facilitates deployment of smart contracts, decentralised applications (dApps), and distributed ledgers with reduced technical overhead and cost.
- Technical capabilities include:
  - Simplified blockchain network setup and management.
  - Integration with existing enterprise systems.
  - Support for multiple blockchain protocols (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric, Ethereum).
- Limitations remain in scalability, interoperability between different blockchain platforms, and data privacy concerns within cloud environments.
- Standards and frameworks are emerging to address interoperability and security, with ongoing efforts to develop consensus algorithms optimised for cloud deployment and privacy-preserving techniques.
