## On Chain Voting

On Chain Voting refers to a component of the blockchain ecosystem.

- Industry adoption of on-chain voting remains cautious but growing, primarily in corporate governance, academic institutions, and limited governmental pilots.
  - Notable platforms include Polyas (Europe-based), Luxoft, and various Ethereum-based smart contract implementations.
  - These systems emphasise end-to-end encryption, real-time monitoring, and compliance with regional electoral laws.
- In the UK, blockchain voting is mostly experimental, with no widespread governmental deployment due to ongoing security and regulatory concerns.
  - North England cities such as Manchester and Leeds host fintech and blockchain innovation hubs exploring governance applications, including voting.
- Technical capabilities:
  - On-chain voting ensures immutability and auditability of votes.
  - Limitations include scalability challenges, vulnerability to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and the persistent risk of endpoint device compromise.
- Standards and frameworks are emerging but not yet universally adopted, with ongoing efforts to align blockchain voting with existing electoral regulations and cybersecurity standards.

## UK Context

- The UK contributes through academic research in cryptography and distributed systems, with institutions in Manchester and Newcastle leading blockchain governance studies.
- North England innovation hubs, including Sheffield’s blockchain incubators and Leeds’ fintech clusters, explore practical applications of on-chain voting in corporate and civic contexts.
- Regional case studies:
  - Pilot projects in Manchester have trialled blockchain for university student elections, demonstrating increased transparency but highlighting user experience challenges.
  - Leeds-based startups are developing blockchain voting modules aimed at local council consultations, balancing regulatory compliance with technological innovation.

## Future Directions

- Emerging trends include integration of zero-knowledge proofs to enhance voter privacy, and hybrid models combining blockchain with traditional voting infrastructure.
- Anticipated challenges:
  - Overcoming cybersecurity threats such as DoS attacks and endpoint vulnerabilities.
  - Achieving regulatory acceptance and public trust, especially in politically sensitive environments.
- Research priorities:
  - Developing scalable, user-friendly architectures.
  - Formal verification of smart contracts used in voting.
  - Comprehensive threat models addressing both technical and social attack vectors.
