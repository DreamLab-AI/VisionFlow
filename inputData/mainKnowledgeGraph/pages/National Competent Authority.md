## National Competent Authority

National Competent Authority refers to a notifying authority, a market surveillance authority, or any other authority designated by a member state to supervise the application and implementation of the ai act, including national data protection authorities where relevant.

- Industry adoption and implementations
  - NCAs are operational across all EU Member States, with each country having designated at least one market surveillance authority and one notifying authority as required by Article 70 of the AI Act
  - NCAs are actively engaged in enforcement, guidance provision, and stakeholder outreach, including support for SMEs and startups
- Notable organisations and platforms
  - Market surveillance authorities are typically embedded within national ministries or regulatory agencies, such as the Bundesnetzagentur in Germany or ANSSI in France
  - Notifying authorities are often technical or standards bodies, such as TÜV in Germany or BSI in the UK
- UK and North England examples where relevant
  - In the UK, the Office for Artificial Intelligence (OAI) and the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) serve as key NCAs for AI regulation, with regional hubs in Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield supporting local innovation and compliance
  - North England’s AI innovation hubs, such as the Digital Catapult in Newcastle and the AI Foundry in Manchester, collaborate closely with NCAs to ensure regional compliance and foster responsible AI development
- Technical capabilities and limitations
  - NCAs are equipped with expertise in AI, cybersecurity, and regulatory compliance, but face challenges in keeping pace with rapid technological change and ensuring consistent enforcement across diverse Member States
  - Resource constraints and varying levels of technical capacity can impact the effectiveness of NCAs, particularly in smaller Member States
- Standards and frameworks
  - NCAs rely on EU-wide standards and frameworks, such as the AI Act’s risk-based approach and the European AI Office’s guidelines, to ensure harmonised enforcement
  - National frameworks often supplement EU requirements, reflecting local legal and regulatory contexts

## UK Context

- British contributions and implementations
  - The UK has established a robust NCA framework for AI regulation, with the OAI and ICO leading enforcement and guidance efforts
  - The UK’s approach emphasises collaboration between national and regional authorities, ensuring a cohesive regulatory environment
- North England innovation hubs (if relevant)
  - North England’s AI innovation hubs, such as the Digital Catapult in Newcastle and the AI Foundry in Manchester, play a key role in supporting local compliance and fostering responsible AI development
  - These hubs collaborate with NCAs to provide technical expertise, guidance, and support for regional stakeholders
- Regional case studies
  - The Digital Catapult in Newcastle has partnered with the ICO to develop compliance tools and training programmes for local AI startups
  - The AI Foundry in Manchester has worked with the OAI to pilot new regulatory approaches, focusing on transparency and accountability in AI systems

## Future Directions

- Emerging trends and developments
  - NCAs are expected to play an increasingly important role in regulating emerging AI technologies, such as generative AI and large language models
  - The European AI Office and the European AI Committee will continue to provide strategic guidance and support to NCAs, ensuring harmonised enforcement across Member States
- Anticipated challenges
  - NCAs will face ongoing challenges in keeping pace with rapid technological change, ensuring consistent enforcement, and addressing resource constraints
  - The rise of cross-border AI applications and services will require greater coordination and collaboration between NCAs
- Research priorities
  - Research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of NCAs in ensuring harmonised enforcement, the impact of resource constraints on regulatory outcomes, and the role of NCAs in fostering innovation and compliance in the AI sector
