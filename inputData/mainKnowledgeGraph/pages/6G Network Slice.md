## 6G Network Slice

6G Network Slice refers to virtual partition of 6g infrastructure guaranteeing specified quality-of-service levels for immersive workloads through isolated resource allocation.

- Industry adoption and implementations
	- Major telecom equipment vendors and operators are actively developing 6G slicing prototypes and testbeds
	- Notable organisations and platforms
		- Ericsson, Nokia, and Huawei are leading in 6G research and development, with ongoing collaborations with academic institutions
		- The UK’s 6G Innovation Centre (6GIC) at the University of Surrey is a key hub for 6G research, including slicing technologies
	- UK and North England examples where relevant
		- The Northern 5G (N5G) project, spanning Manchester, Leeds, and Newcastle, is exploring advanced network slicing for smart city and industrial applications
		- Sheffield’s Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC) is piloting slicing for immersive industrial workloads, such as remote maintenance and digital twinning
- Technical capabilities and limitations
	- 6G slicing is expected to support ultra-low latency (sub-millisecond), massive connectivity, and highly customisable quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees
	- Current limitations include the complexity of cross-domain orchestration, security challenges, and the need for robust standards
- Standards and frameworks
	- The 3GPP is developing 6G slicing specifications, with a focus on interoperability and security
	- The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) is also contributing to 6G slicing standards, particularly in the context of cross-border and multi-operator scenarios
