- ## About Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)
  id:: zero-knowledge-proof-about
	- Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) represent a breakthrough in cryptographic protocols, enabling verification of statements without revealing underlying data. First introduced by Goldwasser, Micali, and Rackoff in 1985, ZKPs satisfy three fundamental properties: completeness (honest provers can convince honest verifiers), soundness (dishonest provers cannot convince honest verifiers of false statements), and zero-knowledge (verifiers learn nothing beyond the truth of the statement). Modern ZKP systems like zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, and Bulletproofs have revolutionized privacy-preserving applications in blockchain, identity systems, and verifiable computation.
	- ### Key Characteristics
	  id:: zero-knowledge-proof-characteristics
		- **Completeness**: If the statement is true, an honest prover can always convince an honest verifier
		- **Soundness**: If the statement is false, no cheating prover can convince an honest verifier except with negligible probability
		- **Zero-Knowledge**: The verifier learns nothing beyond the truth of the statement, with no information leakage about the witness or proof construction
		- **Succinctness**: Modern ZKPs (especially zk-SNARKs) produce compact proofs that are efficient to verify
		- **Non-Interactivity**: Many ZKP systems use the Fiat-Shamir heuristic to eliminate interaction between prover and verifier
		- **Universal Composability**: ZKPs can be combined and composed to create complex privacy-preserving protocols
	- ### Technical Components
	  id:: zero-knowledge-proof-components
		- [[zk-SNARKs]] - Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge: compact proofs with efficient verification, widely used in blockchain (Zcash, Ethereum), requiring trusted setup
		- [[zk-STARKs]] - Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge: transparent setup without trusted ceremony, quantum-resistant, but larger proof sizes
		- [[Bulletproofs]] - Short non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs without trusted setup, efficient for range proofs and confidential transactions
		- [[PLONK]] - Permutations over Lagrange-bases for Oecumenical Noninteractive arguments of Knowledge: universal and updateable trusted setup
		- [[Interactive ZKP]] - Classical protocols requiring multiple rounds of communication between prover and verifier (e.g., Schnorr protocol, graph isomorphism)
		- [[Non-Interactive ZKP]] - Single-message proofs using Fiat-Shamir transformation, enabling asynchronous verification
		- [[Polynomial Commitment Scheme]] - Cryptographic primitive enabling commitment to polynomials with efficient verification (KZG, FRI, IPA)
	- ### Functional Capabilities
	  id:: zero-knowledge-proof-capabilities
		- **Private Authentication**: Prove identity or credentials without revealing sensitive attributes (age verification without disclosing birthdate)
		- **Confidential Transactions**: Execute financial transactions while hiding amounts, senders, and receivers from public observation
		- **Verifiable Computation**: Prove correct execution of complex computations without rerunning the computation (zkVM, zkEVM)
		- **Privacy-Preserving Identity**: Demonstrate possession of credentials, certifications, or memberships without revealing actual documents
		- **Scalable Blockchain Verification**: Enable Layer 2 rollups to batch thousands of transactions with a single succinct proof
		- **Regulatory Compliance**: Prove compliance with regulations (AML/KYC) without exposing private data to auditors
	- ### Use Cases
	  id:: zero-knowledge-proof-use-cases
		- **Blockchain Privacy**: Zcash, Monero, and privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies use ZKPs to hide transaction details while maintaining verifiability
		- **Layer 2 Scaling**: zkRollups (zkSync, StarkNet, Polygon zkEVM) batch transactions off-chain with ZKP verification on-chain
		- **Digital Identity**: Self-sovereign identity systems enabling selective disclosure of credentials without revealing full identity documents
		- **Confidential Voting**: Electronic voting systems that verify eligibility and count votes without revealing individual choices
		- **Decentralized Finance**: Privacy-preserving DeFi protocols enabling confidential trading, lending, and asset management
		- **Supply Chain Verification**: Prove product authenticity and compliance without revealing proprietary manufacturing details
		- **Medical Data Privacy**: Prove medical conditions or test results for insurance or access control without exposing health records
		- **Gaming and Metaverse**: Prove game state, achievements, or asset ownership without revealing strategies or sensitive information
