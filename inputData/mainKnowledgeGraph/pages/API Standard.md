## Academic Context

- Brief contextual overview
  - API standards in the metaverse are foundational for enabling interoperability between diverse digital environments, ensuring that software components can communicate reliably regardless of their underlying architecture or vendor
  - The evolution of these standards reflects broader trends in distributed systems, service-oriented architecture, and the increasing demand for seamless user experiences across virtual platforms

- Key developments and current state
  - Modern API standards have moved beyond simple request-response models to support real-time data exchange, event-driven architectures, and secure identity management
  - The focus has shifted toward open, extensible specifications that accommodate rapid innovation while maintaining backward compatibility

- Academic foundations
  - Rooted in computer science disciplines such as distributed systems, software engineering, and information security
  - Influenced by research into semantic interoperability, service composition, and decentralised identity frameworks

## Current Landscape (2025)

- Industry adoption and implementations
  - Leading metaverse platforms—including those developed by Meta, Microsoft Mesh, and NVIDIA Omniverse—have adopted robust API standards to facilitate integration with third-party tools and services
  - Open standards such as MPAI-MMM (Metaverse Model – Technologies, V2.0) provide a reference architecture for interoperable metaverse instances, enabling independent developers to build compatible clients and services

- Notable organisations and platforms
  - MPAI (Moving Picture, Audio and Data Coding by Artificial Intelligence) has established the MMM-TEC V2.0 standard, which defines how processes and items interact within and across metaverse instances using a rights-based model and inter-process communication protocols
  - IEEE P2048 is developing a comprehensive vocabulary and taxonomy for metaverse systems, supporting consistent terminology and categorisation across industry and academia

- UK and North England examples where relevant
  - UK-based startups and research groups, particularly in Manchester and Leeds, have begun leveraging open API standards to develop immersive experiences for education, healthcare, and cultural heritage
  - The Digital Catapult in Newcastle has supported several pilot projects integrating metaverse APIs with local creative industries, demonstrating practical applications in spatial computing and virtual collaboration

- Technical capabilities and limitations
  - Modern API standards support real-time data synchronisation, secure authentication, and dynamic content sharing across platforms
  - Limitations include challenges in maintaining consistency across decentralised systems, ensuring backward compatibility, and managing the complexity of cross-platform identity and access control

- Standards and frameworks
  - MPAI-MMM API provides a modular framework for building metaverse instances, supporting fast development and deployment
  - IEEE P2048 offers a common language for describing metaverse components and interactions, aiding interoperability and reducing vendor lock-in
