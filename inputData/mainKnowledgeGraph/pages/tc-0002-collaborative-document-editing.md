## Definition

### Primary Definition
**Collaborative Document Editing** - Real-time or asynchronous shared editing technology enabling multiple distributed users to simultaneously create, modify, and comment on digital documents with live synchronization and version control.

### Telecollaboration Context
Collaborative document editing represents a hybrid model within the telecollaboration domain:
- Supports both synchronous (real-time) and asynchronous (time-shifted) collaboration
- Enables knowledge co-creation across geographic and temporal distance
- Reduces meeting overhead through asynchronous contribution
- Provides persistent record of collaborative work
- Supports multiple editing models (free-form, structured, comment-based)

### Key Characteristics
1. Multi-user simultaneous or sequential access
2. Real-time or near-real-time synchronization
3. Persistent version history
4. Comment and feedback mechanisms
5. Access control and permissions
6. Automatic conflict resolution
7. Change tracking and attribution
