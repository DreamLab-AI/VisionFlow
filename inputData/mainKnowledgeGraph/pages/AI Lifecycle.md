  - **Definition**
    - definition:: AI Lifecycle refers to the comprehensive series of distinct, sequential yet iterative phases through which an artificial intelligence system progresses from initial conceptualization to eventual retirement and decommissioning, encompassing planning and design (problem definition, feasibility assessment, requirements specification, ethical considerations), data management (data collection, labeling, quality assurance, governance), model development (algorithm selection, feature engineering, training, hyperparameter tuning, validation), testing and evaluation (performance assessment, robustness testing, fairness evaluation, security testing), deployment and integration (system deployment, production integration, user training, documentation), operation and monitoring (performance monitoring, drift detection, incident management, user feedback collection), maintenance and refinement (model retraining, version management, continuous improvement), and retirement (decommissioning procedures, knowledge preservation, impact assessment), with each phase involving specific activities, stakeholder roles, governance controls, documentation requirements, and quality gates ensuring responsible and effective AI system management aligned with organizational objectives and regulatory obligations. This structured lifecycle framework addresses AI-specific challenges including iterative experimentation during development, continuous monitoring requirements post-deployment to detect model drift and performance degradation, feedback loops enabling model improvement based on operational experience, version control managing model evolution and reproducibility, data lifecycle management ensuring ongoing data quality and relevance, ethical checkpoints at critical decision points assessing fairness and bias implications, compliance verification ensuring adherence to evolving regulations including EU AI Act requirements for high-risk systems, stakeholder engagement throughout incorporating user feedback and expert review, and lifecycle documentation maintaining audit trails, technical specifications, risk assessments, and decision rationale. Implementation models include waterfall approaches with sequential progression through phases, agile methodologies with rapid iteration and continuous delivery, DevOps/MLOps practices automating deployment and monitoring, and hybrid approaches combining structured governance with experimental flexibility, tailored to system complexity, risk level, regulatory context, and organizational maturity as guided by standards including ISO/IEC 42001:2023 AI management systems, NIST AI Risk Management Framework lifecycle integration, and sector-specific guidance from healthcare (FDA), finance (financial services regulations), and public sector (government AI frameworks).

## AI Lifecycle

AI Lifecycle refers to the series of distinct phases through which an artificial intelligence system progresses from initial conception to eventual decommissioning, encompassing planning, design, development, verification, deployment, operation, monitoring, maintenance, and retirement, with each phase involving specific activities, stakeholder roles, documentation requirements, and governance controls to ensure responsible and effective ai system management.

- AI lifecycle adoption is widespread across industries, with frameworks evolving to support automation, scalability, and ethical compliance.
  - Leading organisations employ lifecycle models that break down into design (problem scoping, data planning), development (data preparation, model building), and deployment (integration, monitoring, governance).
  - Continuous delivery pipelines for AI streamline workflows into data handling, model learning, software development, and system operations.
- In the UK, especially in North England, AI initiatives leverage these lifecycle frameworks to foster innovation and responsible deployment.
  - Cities like Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield host AI hubs integrating lifecycle best practices in sectors from healthcare to manufacturing.
- Technical capabilities now include advanced model retraining triggered by data drift detection, automated governance controls, and integration of ethical guardrails.
- Standards such as ISO/IEC 42005:2025 provide formalised guidelines for AI lifecycle governance, risk management, and transparency.
