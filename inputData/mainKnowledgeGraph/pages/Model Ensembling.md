## Model Ensembling

Model Ensembling refers to a technique that combines predictions from multiple independently trained models to improve overall performance and robustness. ensembling leverages diversity among models to reduce variance, improve generalisation, and provide more reliable predictions.

- Industry adoption and implementations
	- Ensembling is widely used in data science competitions, financial forecasting, healthcare analytics, and recommendation systems
	- Major platforms such as Kaggle, Hugging Face, and Ultralytics support ensemble workflows for both research and production
	- In the UK, ensembling is employed by organisations like the Alan Turing Institute, NHS Digital, and various fintech startups
- Notable organisations and platforms
	- The Alan Turing Institute (London) regularly applies ensemble methods in collaborative research projects
	- NHS Digital uses ensembles for predictive analytics in public health, including disease outbreak forecasting
	- Ultralytics HUB provides tools for managing and deploying ensembles built with PyTorch and TensorFlow
- UK and North England examples where relevant
	- The University of Manchester’s Data Science Institute has developed ensemble models for urban air quality prediction
	- Leeds City Council has piloted ensemble-based systems for traffic flow optimisation
	- Newcastle University’s School of Computing Science applies ensembling in smart city initiatives
	- Sheffield’s Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC) uses ensembles for predictive maintenance in industrial settings
- Technical capabilities and limitations
	- Ensembles excel at reducing variance, improving generalisation, and mitigating overfitting
	- However, they increase computational complexity and can be challenging to interpret, especially with stacking and blending
- Standards and frameworks
	- Scikit-learn, XGBoost, and LightGBM are widely used open-source libraries for ensemble learning
	- The UK’s Office for Artificial Intelligence promotes best practices in ensemble deployment, particularly in public sector applications
