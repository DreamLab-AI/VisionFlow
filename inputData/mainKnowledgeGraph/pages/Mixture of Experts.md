## Mixture of Experts

Mixture of Experts refers to an architecture that uses multiple specialised sub-networks (experts) with a gating mechanism that routes inputs to a sparse subset of experts, enabling scaling without proportional compute increases. moe is adopted in production llms like gpt-4, enabling massive scale with controlled costs.

- Industry adoption and implementations
  - MoE is widely used in production LLMs, including models from leading AI companies such as OpenAI, Mistral AI, and Google
  - Notable platforms and models include Mistral’s Mixtral 8x7B, Google’s V-MoE, and various proprietary LLMs that leverage MoE for efficient scaling
  - The architecture is also being explored in other domains, such as computer vision and speech recognition
- UK and North England examples where relevant
  - UK-based AI research institutions and companies are actively contributing to the development and application of MoE architectures
  - The University of Manchester has a strong research group in machine learning, with ongoing projects in scalable AI and efficient neural network architectures
  - Leeds and Newcastle are home to several startups and research labs focusing on AI and machine learning, some of which are exploring MoE for specific applications
  - Sheffield’s Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC) is investigating the use of MoE in industrial AI systems, particularly for predictive maintenance and quality control
- Technical capabilities and limitations
  - MoE enables models to scale to billions of parameters while maintaining efficient inference and training
  - The architecture supports expert parallelism, allowing experts to be distributed across multiple devices for large-scale deployments
  - Challenges include load balancing, distributed training complexity, and tuning for stability and efficiency
  - Careful design and optimisation are required to ensure that the gating network effectively routes inputs and that the experts are well-balanced
- Standards and frameworks
  - There are no formal standards for MoE architectures, but best practices are emerging from the research community
  - Popular deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow provide tools and libraries for implementing MoE models
  - Open-source projects and research repositories offer reference implementations and benchmarks for MoE architectures
