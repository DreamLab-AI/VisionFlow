## Network Topology

Network Topology refers to node connection structure within blockchain systems, providing essential functionality for distributed ledger technology operations and properties.

- Industry adoption of advanced network topology optimisation techniques is accelerating, driven by the exponential growth of Internet-connected devices and the demand for scalable, high-performance networks.
  - Hybrid topologies combining mesh, tree, and star configurations are increasingly common to balance robustness and efficiency.
  - Automated topology optimisation pipelines (e.g., ATOP) leverage machine learning and graph neural networks to design and adapt network structures dynamically[3][4].
- Notable organisations and platforms include telecommunications firms, cloud service providers, and AI research centres worldwide.
  - In the UK, Queen Mary University of London leads pioneering research in higher-order network dynamics, contributing to both theoretical and applied advancements[1].
- Technical capabilities now include:
  - Deep reinforcement learning for topology optimisation in wireless and wired networks.
  - Enhanced modelling of communication-computation trade-offs in decentralised optimisation algorithms[7].
- Limitations remain in the scalability of some optimisation methods and the complexity of accurately modelling multi-layered, heterogeneous networks.
- Standards and frameworks continue to evolve, with growing emphasis on interoperability, security, and adaptability to emerging technologies such as 6G and edge computing.
