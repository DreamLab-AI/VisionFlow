## Academic Context

- Brief contextual overview
	- Legged robots represent a dynamic subfield of robotics, focusing on machines capable of locomotion via articulated limbs rather than wheels or tracks
	- These systems are inspired by biological movement and are designed to operate in complex, unstructured environments where wheeled or tracked robots struggle
	- The field has evolved from early bio-inspired prototypes to sophisticated platforms capable of autonomous navigation, adaptive gait control, and real-world deployment

- Key developments and current state
	- Advances in control theory, materials science, and embedded computing have enabled legged robots to achieve greater agility, robustness, and autonomy
	- Modern legged robots are increasingly used in research, industry, and public service, with applications ranging from search and rescue to logistics and environmental monitoring
	- The integration of machine learning and sensor fusion has further enhanced their ability to adapt to changing terrains and tasks

- Academic foundations
	- Theoretical work on central pattern generators (CPGs) and feedback/feedforward control systems underpins much of the current research in legged locomotion
	- Pioneering studies in biomechanics and robotics have established foundational principles for gait generation, stability, and energy efficiency
