## Autonomous Navigation

Autonomous Navigation refers to autonomous navigation encompasses the complete system capability for a robot or autonomous agent to move from one location to another without human guidance, integrating perception, localisation, mapping, path planning, obstacle avoidance, and control. autonomous navigation systems employ slam, sensor fusion, and ai-based decision-making to operate in unknown or dynamic environments.

- Industry adoption and implementations
  - Autonomous navigation is widely adopted in manufacturing, logistics, healthcare, and agriculture.
  - Notable organisations and platforms
    - Robotnik: Specialises in autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) for industrial applications, with a focus on SLAM and AI-driven navigation.
    - MiR (Mobile Industrial Robots): Provides AMRs for logistics and manufacturing, with advanced localisation and path planning capabilities.
    - Relay Robotics: Develops indoor delivery robots with autonomous navigation, using external aids like reflectors and beacons.
  - UK and North England examples where relevant
    - Manchester: Home to the National Graphene Institute and the Manchester Robotics Lab, which are at the forefront of robotics research and development.
    - Leeds: The University of Leeds and Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust are collaborating on autonomous delivery robots for healthcare settings.
