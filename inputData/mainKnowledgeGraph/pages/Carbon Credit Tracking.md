## Carbon Credit Tracking

Carbon Credit Tracking refers to a component of the blockchain ecosystem.

- Industry adoption and implementations
	- Blockchain-based carbon credit platforms are now widely adopted, with major registries and financial institutions integrating distributed ledger technology
	- Leading platforms include KlimaDAO, Toucan, Carbonmark, and Verra’s blockchain-enabled registry solutions
	- Tokenisation of carbon credits allows for fractional ownership and microtransactions, increasing accessibility for smaller investors and projects
	- Smart contracts automate verification and settlement, reducing intermediary costs and enhancing efficiency
- Notable organisations and platforms
	- Kinexys (J.P. Morgan) has developed a blockchain application for tokenising carbon market registries, with testing underway by S&P Global, EcoRegistry, and the International Carbon Registry
	- Nasdaq has invested in blockchain solutions to digitise carbon credit registries and streamline pre-issuance processes
	- Carbonmark automates purchase and retirement flows, integrates with fintech applications, and supports fractionalised credits
- UK and North England examples where relevant
	- UK-based fintechs and environmental consultancies are increasingly adopting blockchain for carbon credit tracking, particularly in Manchester, Leeds, and Newcastle
	- The Northern Powerhouse initiative has supported several pilot projects exploring blockchain for environmental asset management, including carbon credits
	- Local authorities in Sheffield have partnered with tech firms to pilot blockchain-based tracking for municipal carbon offsetting schemes
- Technical capabilities and limitations
	- Blockchain provides a tamper-proof ledger for the entire lifecycle of carbon credits, from issuance to retirement
	- Integration with IoT sensors, satellites, and AI enables real-time monitoring and automated verification
	- Limitations include upfront development costs, transaction fees, and the need for standardisation across platforms
- Standards and frameworks
	- Regulatory bodies are developing standardised smart contract frameworks to harmonise cross-border carbon trading protocols
	- The International Carbon Registry and other major registries are adopting blockchain standards to ensure uniformity and trust
