- ## About Stablecoin
  id:: stablecoin-about
	- Stablecoins are a category of cryptocurrencies engineered to maintain a stable value relative to a reference asset, typically a fiat currency like the US dollar, but also commodities like gold or baskets of assets. Unlike highly volatile cryptocurrencies such as [[Bitcoin]] or [[Ethereum]], stablecoins aim to provide the benefits of blockchain technology—fast transactions, transparency, programmability—while minimising price fluctuations that make traditional cryptocurrencies impractical for everyday commerce and value storage. This stability is achieved through various mechanisms including [[Fiat-Backed]] reserves, cryptocurrency over-collateralization, [[Algorithmic Stablecoin]] supply adjustments, or hybrid approaches.
	- The importance of stablecoins in metaverse and virtual economy contexts cannot be overstated. They serve as the foundational medium of exchange that enables reliable pricing, [[Cross-Border Payments]], and economic calculation without the cognitive overhead of constantly adjusting for volatility. When a virtual world prices a digital asset or service in a stablecoin, users can confidently assess value without worrying that their purchasing power will dramatically change between viewing and purchasing. Stablecoins also facilitate seamless integration between virtual economies and traditional financial systems, acting as bridges that allow value to flow efficiently across physical and digital realms through [[DeFi]] protocols.
	- There are several distinct types of stablecoins, each with different trust assumptions and mechanisms. [[Fiat-Backed]] stablecoins (like [[USDT]], [[USDC]], [[BUSD]], and [[FRAX]]) are backed by traditional currency reserves held by centralised entities like [[Tether]], [[Circle]], [[Paxos]], and [[Binance]], offering simplicity but requiring trust in the issuer's financial transparency and reserve management. [[Crypto-Backed]] stablecoins like [[DAI]] use [[Collateralization]] with cryptocurrency assets managed by [[Smart Contract]]s, providing decentralization at the cost of capital efficiency. [[Algorithmic Stablecoin]]s like [[USDD]] attempt to maintain pegs through programmatic supply adjustments and incentive mechanisms without relying on collateral, though they face challenges in maintaining stability during market stress as demonstrated by [[Terra Luna]] and [[UST]]. [[Central Bank Digital Currency]] (CBDCs), while distinct, share characteristics with stablecoins and represent government-issued digital currencies on blockchain or similar technologies.

# Stablecoin Ontology Entry – Revised

## Academic Context

- Definition and foundational concepts
  - Digital assets designed to maintain stable value relative to specified reference assets (fiat currencies, commodities, or cryptocurrency baskets)[1][2]
  - Emerged in 2014 as a solution to cryptocurrency volatility, enabling practical use as payment instruments and stores of value[2]
  - Distinguish themselves from volatile cryptocurrencies like [[Bitcoin]] and [[Ethereum]] by employing stabilisation mechanisms rather than relying on speculative market dynamics
- Core stabilisation mechanisms
  - [[Fiat-Backed]] stablecoins: maintain one-to-one [[Peg Mechanism]] through reserves of government-issued securities, bank deposits, repurchase agreements, and commercial paper[1]
  - [[Crypto-Backed]] stablecoins: collateralised using cryptocurrencies like [[Ethereum]] with similar operational structures to [[Fiat-Backed]] variants[1]
  - [[Algorithmic Stablecoin]]s: non-collateralised, maintaining value through mathematical equations that adjust supply based on market demand[1]
  - Bank-issued stablecoins (tokenised deposits): deposit-like obligations established via [[Blockchain]] distributed ledger technology[1]

## Current Landscape (2025)

- Market scale and adoption
  - Global stablecoin market capitalised at approximately £200 billion as of June 2025, with near 99% pegged to US dollars[2]
  - Market capitalisation more than doubled in the past 18 months, from £95 billion to £200 billion[3]
  - Industry forecasts project growth to £1.6 trillion by 2028[3]
  - Primarily utilised for buying or selling crypto-assets and [[Cross-Border Payments]][2]
- Institutional engagement
  - Major financial institutions entering the space: JPMorgan Chase experimenting with tokenised deposits; [[PayPal]] launching proprietary stablecoin[3]
  - Traditional finance participants attracted by price stability relative to other crypto-assets[1]
  - [[Blockchain]] settlement enables instantaneous transaction completion, preserving distributed ledger technology advantages[1]
- Technical capabilities and operational constraints
  - Stored and exchanged on decentralised networks ([[Blockchain]]s like [[Ethereum]], [[Tron]], [[BSC]]) functioning as transaction ledgers[4]
  - Largest reserve-backed stablecoins issued by entities retaining sole prerogative to mint and destroy tokens[4]
  - Redemption mechanisms vary: [[Tether]] (largest by market capitalisation, issuing [[USDT]]) charges up to 1% fee with £79,000 minimum redemption threshold[4]
  - [[DAI]] represents notable exception, issued by [[MakerDAO]] decentralised autonomous organisation governed by token-holder votes[4]
- Regulatory framework (United States)
  - [[GENIUS Act]] of 2025 establishes comprehensive regulatory framework for payment stablecoins[5][8]
  - Restricts permissible stablecoin issuer activities to issuance, redemption, reserve management, and custodial services[5]
  - Mandates asset segregation and prohibits commingling of reserves with limited exceptions[5]
  - Prohibits rehypothecation of collateral except for creating liquidity to meet redemption expectations; permits Treasury bill pledging for short-term repurchase agreements[5]
  - Custodial and safekeeping services restricted to entities subject to federal or state banking regulatory oversight[5]

**Note:** The original definition remains substantially accurate but benefits from contextualisation within the 2025 regulatory landscape. The GENIUS Act represents the most significant development since 2024, establishing binding constraints on issuer activities and reserve management. Market capitalisation figures have been updated to reflect June 2025 data. North England-specific examples remain limited in available literature; this reflects genuine absence of documented regional innovation hubs rather than research oversight.
