## Object Detection

Object Detection refers to object detection is the computer vision task of identifying and localising multiple objects within an image by predicting bounding boxes and class labels for each detected instance. object detectors (yolo, faster r-cnn, detr) combine classification and localisation, outputting spatial coordinates and class probabilities for all objects of interest in real-time or near-real-time performance.

- Industry adoption spans autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, medical imaging, retail inventory management, and agricultural monitoring[5]
  - Real-time decision-making capabilities enable practical deployment in safety-critical applications[5]
  - Confidence scoring mechanisms provide quantifiable uncertainty estimates alongside predictions[4]
- Technical capabilities and performance characteristics
  - Single-stage detectors achieve real-time performance through unified prediction pipelines[2]
  - Two-stage detectors employ region proposal mechanisms followed by refinement, trading latency for enhanced accuracy[2]
  - Mask R-CNN extends capabilities to pixel-wise segmentation for detailed object delineation[2]
  - Non-maximum suppression techniques resolve overlapping bounding box predictions[3]
- Processing pipeline standardisation
  - Input preprocessing enhances image quality and normalisation[2]
  - Feature extraction isolates shape, texture, and colour characteristics[2]
  - Algorithm application generates predictions with associated confidence metrics[2]
  - Bounding box coordinate calculation and post-processing derive actionable insights[3]
- Current limitations remain evident in edge cases
  - Occlusion handling and small object detection present ongoing challenges
  - Domain-specific fine-tuning requirements persist despite transfer learning advances
  - Computational resource demands vary significantly across model architectures
