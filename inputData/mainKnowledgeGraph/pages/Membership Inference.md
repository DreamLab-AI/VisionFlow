## Academic Context

- Membership inference is a privacy attack targeting machine learning models, where an adversary attempts to determine whether a specific data point was included in the model’s training dataset by analysing the model’s output behaviour on that input
  - The attack exploits differences in how models respond to data they have seen during training versus data they have not, often due to overfitting or memorisation effects
  - This can reveal sensitive information about individuals’ participation in datasets, posing risks to privacy and data protection
  - The concept was formally introduced in seminal work by Shokri et al. (2017), which demonstrated the feasibility of such attacks across various model architectures and cloud-based services

## Current Landscape (2025)

- Industry adoption of machine learning has increased the relevance of membership inference attacks, particularly in sectors handling sensitive personal data such as finance, healthcare, and public services
  - Major cloud providers and AI platforms have implemented mitigation strategies, including differential privacy and model obfuscation, to reduce the risk of membership inference
  - In the UK, organisations such as the Alan Turing Institute and NHS Digital have published guidance on privacy-preserving machine learning, reflecting growing awareness of these threats
  - North England innovation hubs, including the Digital Health Enterprise Zone in Greater Manchester, are actively researching privacy-preserving AI techniques, with some projects focusing on mitigating membership inference in healthcare applications
