## AI Governance Maturity Model

AI Governance Maturity Model refers to ai governance maturity model is an assessment framework that defines progressive maturity levels for ai governance capabilities across multiple dimensions, enabling organizations to evaluate current practices, identify gaps, benchmark against peers, and guide continuous improvement toward trustworthy ai deployment. these models characterize maturity through defined levels (typically 1-5) representing progression from ad-hoc reactive practices to optimised proactive governance, with each level specifying capabilities, processes, and artefacts expected at that stage. maturity dimensions typically include governance structure and leadership (executive commitment, organizational roles, policy frameworks), risk management (identification, assessment, mitigation, monitoring), ethical practices (principles adoption, ethics review processes, fairness auditing), technical practices (documentation standards, testing protocols, monitoring systems), compliance and audit (regulatory alignment, audit procedures, evidence collection), stakeholder engagement (consultation processes, transparency practices, redress mechanisms), and continuous improvement (metrics collection, lessons learned, iterative enhancement). assessment methodology involves self-assessment questionnaires, evidence review (documentation, process artefacts, system logs), stakeholder interviews, and external validation, producing maturity scores, gap analysis, and improvement roadmaps. benefits include structured governance development avoiding ad-hoc approaches, prioritization of high-impact improvements, demonstration of due diligence to regulators and stakeholders, and facilitation of organizational learning. models draw on maturity model methodologies from capability maturity model integration (cmmi), iso 21827 systems security engineering capability maturity model, and data governance maturity models, adapted for ai-specific governance challenges. implementation examples include the singapore model ai governance framework maturity assessment and organizational maturity models from leading ai governance practitioners.

- Industry adoption and implementations
	- AI governance maturity models are widely adopted across public and private sectors, including government agencies, financial institutions, and healthcare providers
	- Notable organisations and platforms
		- CNA’s AI Maturity Model for Government Agencies provides a structured approach for evaluating AI governance across five domains: governance, resourcing, impact, trustworthiness, and security
		- The AI Governance Maturity Matrix, developed by researchers at Berkeley, offers boards a roadmap across five dimensions: Strategy & Vision, People & Expertise, Processes & Analytics, Ethics & Oversight, and Culture & Collaboration
		- Athena Solutions’ AI Governance Framework 2025 provides a practical checklist for implementing governance, including leadership buy-in, cross-functional teams, ethical principles, and risk assessment
	- UK and North England examples where relevant
		- Local authorities in Manchester and Leeds have piloted AI governance maturity assessments to guide smart city initiatives and public service automation
		- Newcastle City Council has integrated AI governance maturity principles into its digital transformation strategy, focusing on transparency and public trust
		- Sheffield’s Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC) uses maturity models to ensure responsible AI deployment in industrial automation
- Technical capabilities and limitations
	- Models enable organisations to benchmark their AI governance practices, identify gaps, and prioritise improvements
	- Limitations include the challenge of quantifying qualitative aspects such as organisational culture and ethical oversight
	- Some models struggle to keep pace with rapid technological change and emerging regulatory requirements
- Standards and frameworks
	- NIST AI Risk Management Framework provides a flexible foundation for AI governance maturity models
	- ISO/IEC 42001 (AI management system) offers international standards for AI governance
	- UK-specific guidance from the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation (CDEI) and the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) complements global frameworks
