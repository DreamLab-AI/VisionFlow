- ## Key use cases
	- ### [[Digital Art]]
		- The recent surge of interest in [[NFT|NFT's]] during 2024-2025 has been largely driven by [[Digital art]] and [[Generative art]], building on foundations established since 2014. [[Digital artists]] like [[Kevin McCoy]] pioneered [[NFT art]], with his *Quantum* widely recognised as foundational work. By 2025, [[NFT]] art sales represent significant value in the [[Art market]]. High profile [[Digital artists]] such as [[Beeple]] helped bring [[NFT|NFT's]] into mainstream awareness through record-breaking sales. The [[Art community]] now widely uses [[Digital objects]] for [[Provenance]], [[Authenticity verification]], and [[Direct sales to collectors]].

		- [[Art]] as [[NFT|NFT's]] offer the following advantages:
			- ##### [[Immutable]] [[Authenticity]]
				- [[Art fraud]] such as false representation, [[Forgeries]], and [[Plagiarism]] have been a recurring issue. [[Artists]] and [[Artworks]] have been open to abuse by forgers. Unless a work is documented, the *nominal authenticity* can change over time. At its most basic level, once a work is 'minted' as an [[NFT]] on the [[Blockchain]], this functions as an immutable, publicly accessible proof of [[Ownership]] and creation. [[Minting]] is not limited to [[Digital art]]; any physical art (sculpture, painting, installation) can be represented digitally. [[NFT]] owners can possess the physical artwork alongside the [[Digital object]]. This provides secure, immutable [[Provenance]] for the [[Blockchain]] lifetime.
			- ##### [[Digital Provenance]]
				- [[Provenance]] (chain of custody) is crucial in [[Art]], [[Antiques]], and [[Collectibles]]. It helps assign work to artists and documents ownership history. [[Digital provenance]], an inherent feature of [[NFT|NFT's]], eliminates historical challenges in tracking [[Art ownership]]. The [[Blockchain]] serves as an open, secure [[Distributed ledger]] providing more trustworthy [[Provenance]] than traditional methods. [[Digital provenance]] allows [[Artists]] and [[Collectors]] to record secure, permanent, unalterable transaction history, providing future owners complete trust in [[Art ownership]] and [[Custody]].
			- ##### [[Decentralized]] [[Automated royalty payments|Royalty Automation]]
				- Traditionally, secondary and subsequent [[Art sales]] benefit only the buyer/collector, not the [[Artist]]. With [[NFT|NFT's]], [[Royalty payments]] can be [[Automated]] in perpetuity via [[Smart contracts]]. [[Smart contracts]] are automated scripts that execute predetermined conditions. [[Artist royalties]] can now be enforced through [[Smart contract]] logic, enabling the [[Creator economy]] to thrive. By 2025, many [[NFT]] platforms support [[Royalty enforcement]] at the protocol level.
			- ##### [[Royalty distribution]]
				- [[Royalty payments]] are automatically distributed to the [[Creator]] on each resale. Modern systems allow [[Artists]] and [[Collectors]] to benefit from [[Secondary markets]].
				- [[Smart contract]]-driven [[NFT|NFT's]] ensure that regardless of how many times a piece is resold across [[Collectors]], the [[Artist]] receives predetermined [[Royalty payments]] from each transaction.
				- Historically, [[Art provenance]] spans generations, but [[Traditional art markets]] rarely benefit [[Artists]]' descendants. [[NFT]] [[Smart contracts]] enable lasting [[Generational wealth transfer]]. As long as the creator's [[Digital wallet]] is accessible, the [[Blockchain]] becomes an everlasting [[Digital patron]].
				- NFT art currently suffers from the same failure of decentralisationalready discussed in the Ethererum technology stack, but this iscompounded by the normalisation of intermediate art brokers [continuingto custody](https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html)the NFTs even after sale. They are usually selling a pointer to theirown servers. The market is nascent and evolving, but it’s currently notdelivering on it’s core promise.
				- Proof of ownership is intuitively a pretty obvious application for thetechnology, but again it’s hard to justify the expense when the benefitsare so slim. [Bulldogs on theblockchain](https://www.bullishlybred.com/) is a clear gimmick, andmight even incentivise poor behaviours as there are two products herewhich are not necessarily aligned. Much has been written over the yearsabout [deeds to property](https://propy.com/browse/propy-nft/) beingpassed through blockchains, cutting out the middle man, but in the eventthat a house deed NFT was hacked and stolen it’s obviously not the casethat the property would then pass to the hacker.
				- One of the most interesting companies is Yuga Labs, who launched theincredibly popular Bored Ape Yacht club set of 10,000 algorithmicallygenerated NFTs. These Ethereum based NFTs were based loosely on the‘Crypto Punks’ model of PFP-NFT (variously profile picture project,picture for proof, and picture for profile
				- no definition remainsuncontested for long). Yuga launched with a better commercialisationmodel for the holders, and a strong marketing drive into celebritycircles. They now regularly change hands for hundreds of thousands ofpounds. Even this ‘blue chip’ NFT is not without [seriouscriticism](https://twitter.com/coryklippsten/status/1538909505236283392):it“I’d put it at 99.99% the project is in fact a deliberate troll,intentionally replete with Nazi symbols and esoteric racist dogwhistles”
				- Yuga recently bought the artistic rights to the commercial reuse ofsimilarly popular (and preceding) Punks set. This is interesting becausethey have again handed the commercial re-use rights to the owners of theindividual NFTs. This raises the same [confusingproblem](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-21/bored-ape-nft-spinoff-venture-gone-sour-sparks-legal-fight)with attaching commercial rights to an easily stolen token as NFTs forreal estate does. This has been demonstrated recently when Seth Greenhad a Bored Ape stolen after [creating an animated show around it’sIP](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/sarahemerson/seth-green-bored-ape-stolen-tv-show).Many more contradictions and ambiguities in NFT licences are emerging.Galaxy Digital have [surveyed thelandscape](https://www.galaxy.com/research/insights/a-survey-of-nft-licences-facts-and-fictions/):it“Contrary to the ethos of Web3, NFTs today convey exactly zeroownership rights for the underlying artwork to their token holders.Instead, the arrangements between NFT issuers and token holders resemblea distinctly web maze of opaque, misleading, complex, and restrictivelicensing agreements, and popular secondary markets like OpenSea provideno material disclosures regarding these arrangements to purchasers.Something more is required, and that ‘something’ is a legal agreementbetween the owner of the image—known as the ‘copyright holder’ and theNFT holder specifying what rights the NFT holder has with respect to theimage. To the extent an NFT purchaser has any rights to the imageassociated with his or her NFT at all, those rights flow not from his orher ownership of the token, but from the terms and conditions containedin the licence issued by the NFT Project governing the NFT holder’spurchase and use of the image. Accordingly, for the vast majority of NFTprojects, owning the NFT does not mean you own the corresponding digitalcontent that is displayed when you sync your wallet to OpenSea. Thatcontent, as it turns out, is owned and retained by the owner of thecopyright associated with that digital content, typically the NFTproject. After reviewing the most used licence agreements for NFTprojects, it becomes apparent that NFT standards and smart contracts donot recognise off-chain law.” There may already be a response from theindustry to this in the shape of [a16z’s “can’t be evil” licenseproposal](https://a16zcrypto.com/introducing-nft-licences/).
				- Even so, the community around these collections is incredibly strong,mixing developers, artists, the rich and famous, and the fortunate andearly, into a cohesive community who communicate online. The developer‘good will’ is enormous, and it seems possible that this will lead tofaster and broader innovation around the collections, and out into[metaverseapplications](https://twitter.com/yugalabs/status/1505014986556551172?).The brand is strong, and the individual NFT items both benefit from, andreinforce that brand, while adding personal narratives and humaninterest.
				- As a gauge of how frothy this market still is it’s interesting to lookat the APE token which Yuga just launched. They airdropped 10,000 of thetokens free to each of the 10,000 NFT holders. This instantly created amulti-billion dollar market cap, and a top 50 ‘crypto’ out of thin air,based purely on their brand. It’s clear that there is both brand, and amarket here.
				- A recent report from "Base Layer" tries to capture the community‘feature’ of big brand NFTs. [“Crypto culturedecoded”](https://baselayer.so/crypto-culture-decoded) explains that isis these online communities which are the attraction not necessarily theart. This is a powerful ‘in group’ argument, though speculation remainsthe most likely underpinning.
				- While it is likely that this is currently a speculative bubble, that is[waning already](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-61102759) (Figure<a href="#fig:monkey" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:monkey">[fig:monkey]</a>),it seems certain that the technology is here to stay in some form.

			- #### [[Gaming]] & [[Video games]]
				- [[Computer games]] and [[Video games]] are a massive global industry. By 2025, the [[Gaming industry]] revenues exceed both the [[Film industry]] and [[Sports industry]] combined.
				- A global industry with revenues over £200b, with nearly half the people on the planet playing some form of [[Games]] in 2025.
				- As the [[Games industry]] has evolved, [[Secondary markets]] have emerged, most notably the [[Retro gaming]] and [[Used games]] resale market. The market for [[Gaming collectibles]] demonstrates lucrative opportunities for [[Private resellers]].
				- Despite publishers and developers moving to [[Digital-only games]], the demand for [[Used games]] remains incredibly high in 2025.
				- Whilst some retailers have adapted their business models to [[Reselling]] of [[Retro games]], the vast majority of [[Publishers]] and [[Developers]] aren't able to directly benefit from the emerging [[Secondary games market]]. The potential of [[Gaming NFTs]] and [[Digital game assets]] presents a huge opportunity for [[Publishers]], [[Developers]], and [[Players]], offering the following advantages:
			- ##### [[Royalty sales]] on [[Pre-owned games]]
				- A predetermined proportion of any resale of a [[Used game]] can be automated in perpetuity via [[Smart contracts]]. Traditionally only the initial first sale benefits [[Publishers]]/[[Developers]], with secondary sales only benefiting the [[Purchaser]]. However, [[Smart contract]]-driven [[Gaming NFTs]] mean that if a [[Game]] is sold/resold through thousands of [[Collectors]], a pre-determined [[Royalty payment]] rate set by the [[Publisher]] is automatically distributed on every future sale.
			- ##### [[User-generated content]] [[Monetization]]
				- [[Gaming NFTs]] offer ability to monetize [[User-generated content]]. Major [[Video games]] like [[Pokemon Go]], [[Destiny 2]], and [[Genshin Impact]] have massive established player bases in 2025. These games are designed to encourage extensive play; top players have amassed thousands of hours. By 2025, the opportunity to monetize [[Player-created content]] and [[In-game assets]] through [[NFT|NFTs]] represents significant economic potential.
				- Destiny/Pokemon Go and Genshin Impact revolve around a central key gamemechanic; players investing significant amounts of time collecting ingame digital assets; characters/weapons/items, often classed as ‘rare’or ‘exotic’ or ‘5 Star’. These collectibles usually found by acombination of the accrual of in-game time, completing quests,purchasing additional in-game items/boosters, and luck (‘RNG’). Playersare often encouraged to share their collections of rarecharacters/weapons/ objects through in-game achievements, triumphs,scores acting as a mark of distinction/status symbol.
				- Traditionally there has been nothing that went beyond sharing the*digital badge* (i.e triumph/achievement/accomplishment) on a on socialmedia/gamer’s platform profile. However NFT’s offer the ideal system fordevelopers/publishers and even players to monetise usergenerated/customised data (such as a players unique save game data),simultaneously allowing: a) creation of an additional monetisedecosystem to meet player demands i.e. some players who are willing tomonetise and ‘sell’ their invested time in a particular product/serviceto other players with little time but willing to pay other players for‘grinding’ (progressing laborious in game tasks) and a more advancedin-game progression point. The potential to providepublishers/developers with an additional long-term income stream,providing a better ROI on computer & video game development, which inmany instances can cost hundreds of millions in development costsspanning 5/10 years, is undeniable.
				- This use case is where our focus lies, as it is now far easier for users to generate content with the support of AI. Note that ideas also can count as content.
			- ##### [[Play-to-earn]] [[Revenue models]]
				- [[Play-to-earn]] models represent an evolution in [[Game economics]], though market conditions in 2024-2025 show cautious development. Structural issues in [[Web3 gaming]] economics continue to be studied and refined. [[Bot]] activity and [[Market manipulation]] remain concerns in early-stage [[Play-to-earn]] systems.
			- ##### [[In-game collectibles]] [[Monetization]]
				- [[Customizable in-game assets]] including [[Cosmetic items]] and [[Collectible items]] that offer [[Player advantages]] can be tokenized as [[Gaming NFTs]].
				- Traditional gamers have pushed back on the seemingly useful idea ofintegrating NTFs with traditional games. This may be in part becauseEthereum mining has kept graphics card prices high for a decade.

					- Justin Kan, co-founder of twitch: it“NFTs are a better business modelfor games. Many gamers seem to be raging hard against game studiosselling NFTs. But NFTs are also better for players. Here’s why I thinkblockchain games will be the predominant business model in gaming in tenyears. NFTs are a better business model for funding games . Example:recently I invested in a new web3 game SynCityHQ. They are building amafia metaverse and raised $3M in their initial NFT drop.  NFTs give studios access to a new capital market for raising capitalfrom the crowd.NFTs can be a better ongoing model for games. Web3 gameswill open economies, and by building the games on open and programmableassets (tokens + NFTs) they will create far more economic value thanthey could from any one game. Imagine Fortnite, but other developers canbuild experiences on top of the V-Bucks and skins. Epic would get aroyalty every time any transaction happens. As big as Fortnite is today,Open Fortnite could be much bigger, because it will be a true platform.NFTs are better for gamers Allowing gamers to have ownership of theassets they buy and earn in game allows them to participate in thepotential growth of a game. It lets gamers preserve some economic valuewhen they switch to playing something new. But what about the criticismsof NFTs?  Here are my thoughts on the common FUDs: "It’s just a money grab on thepart of the studios!"  Game studios already switched over to the model of selling in-gameitems, cosmetics, etc to players long ago. But currently the digitalstuff players are buying isn’t re-sellable. NFT ownership is strictlybetter for players. "The games aren’t real games." This reminds me ofthe criticism of free-to-play in 2008, when the games were Mafia Wars /FarmVille. We haven’t had time for great developers to create incredibleexperiences yet. Everyone investing in games knows there are great teamsbuilding. "Game NFTs aren’t really decentralized because they rely onmodels / assets inside centralised game clients." Crypto is as much amovement as it is a technology. Putting items on a blockchain is whatgives people trust that they have participatory ownership...which makepeople willing to buy in to the game. These assets are “backed” byblockchain. The fact that these item collections are NFTs will makeother people willing to build on top of them. "NFTs are bad for theenvironment." Solana and L2s solve this. NFT games are better forplayers and for game developers. Like the free-to-play revolutionchanged gaming, so will blockchain. The games of the future will befully robust, with open and programmable economies.”
			- ### [[Broader digital object uses]] and [[Metaverse]] applications
				- By 2025, [[NFT|NFTs]] and [[Digital objects]] are categorised into diverse use cases:
					- [[Profile pictures|PFP NFTs]]: Originally popular on [[Social media]], these identity-based [[Digital collectibles]] have evolved into more sophisticated [[Avatar systems]] for [[Metaverse]] environments. The intersection of [[Social identity]] and [[Virtual worlds]] is a growing area.
					- [[Digital music]] and [[Music NFTs]]: [[Artists]] are using [[NFT|NFTs]] to distribute [[Music rights]] and [[Royalties]] directly to fans. Platforms are experimenting with [[Music NFTs]] and [[Creator economy]] models. [[Music]] represents a [[Creator economy]] opportunity where [[Artists]] can distribute value directly to [[Audiences]].
					- [[Gaming]]: Major companies including [[Lego]], [[Blizzard]], [[Epic]], and [[Ubisoft]] are investing in [[Gaming NFTs]] as of 2025.
					- [[Event tickets]] and [[Digital memorabilia]]: [[NFT]] tickets enable [[Event organizers]] to collect [[Royalties]] on [[Secondary market]] sales. [[Sporting events]] and [[Concerts]] are increasingly using [[Digital tickets]] and [[Collectible memorabilia]].
						- *[[Royalty]] models allow [[Event organizers]] to benefit from [[Ticket appreciation]]. [[Smart contracts]] enable automatic [[Commission distribution]] on resales.*
				- [[Virtual event tickets]] and [[Metaverse]] events represent growth areas for 2025.
					- [[Membership tokens]]: [[Utility NFTs]] and [[Access tokens]] allow [[Membership programmes]] and [[Exclusive communities]].
					- [[Virtual property]] and [[Metaverse]] applications: [[NFT|NFTs]] are crucial for [[Metaverse]] development. [[Virtual real estate]], [[Digital land]], and [[Immersive environments]] increasingly use [[Digital objects]] for ownership and trading by 2025.
					- [[Luxury brands]] and [[Physical-digital hybrids]]: By 2025, major [[Luxury goods]] companies integrate [[NFT|NFTs]] with [[Physical products]]. [[Phygital]] (physical + digital) strategies enable brands to prove [[Authenticity]], create [[Secondary markets]], and connect with [[Metaverse]] experiences. [[Luxury provenance]] is enhanced through [[Blockchain]] technology.
				- It is completely reasonable to assert that these use cases could be accomplished without the use of NFT technology, and is part of the hype bubble.
				- Twitter user Cantino.Eth offers an exhaustive roundup of what they think future uses might be. It’s a [thread full of industry insider jargon](https://twitter.com/chriscantino/status/1542930648750608387)) but it’s indicative of a shift in focus from speculation to ‘building’ asthe market conditions change.
				- {{twitter https://twitter.com/chriscantino/status/1542930648750608387)}}
				- Use cases identified for 2025 and beyond:
					- [[Hobby tokens]]: Demonstrating interest in activities. This serves to drive [[Community formation]] and [[Social signaling]].
					- [[Professional credentials]]: [[Qualification NFTs]] and [[Professional badges]] for [[Skill verification]] and [[Credentials]].
					- [[Membership badges]]: [[Distributed project]] participation and [[Community affiliation]] tokens.
					- [[Loyalty programmes]]: [[Retail incentives]], [[Brand loyalty]], and [[Early access programmes]] enabled through [[NFT|NFTs]].
					- [[Community challenges]]: [[Collective milestones]] and [[Team-based incentive]] programmes.
					- [[User-generated content]] [[Monetization]]: [[Content creator]] [[Royalties]] and [[IP rights]] management.
					- [[Soulbound tokens]]: Non-transferable [[Account-bound NFTs]] for [[Reputation]], [[Achievements]], and [[Identity verification]].
					- [[Educational credentials]]: [[Skill certificates]] and [[Verified learning]] records on the [[Blockchain]].
					- [[Smart contract]]–based ownership: [[Digital contracts]], [[Conditional ownership]], and [[Asset transfer]] logic enabled through [[Blockchain]] integration.
- ### [[Digital objects]] in collaborative [[Mixed reality]] applications
	- By 2025, there has been a shift toward [[Digital objects]] terminology and away from purely [[NFT]] branding. [[Digital objects]] are considered crucial for [[Metaverse]] development. [[Avatar collectibles]] and [[Digital assets]] in [[Virtual worlds]] are increasingly mainstream.
	- Multiple platforms provide paths to [[Digital assets]]:
	- #### [[Bitcoin]] layer solutions
		- [[Liquid Network]]: A mature [[Bitcoin sidechain]] developed by [[Blockstream]], enabling [[Asset issuance]] and [[Token creation]]. [[Liquid]] offers [[Privacy]] and [[Scalability]] improvements while maintaining [[Bitcoin]] security.
		- [[Bitcoin ordinals]]: [[Satoshi inscriptions]] enable [[Digital artefact]] storage directly on the [[Bitcoin blockchain]], providing [[Immutability]] and [[Security]].
		- [[Taproot assets]]: Next-generation [[Asset issuance]] protocol leveraging [[Taproot]] for [[Privacy]] and [[Efficiency]].
	- #### [[Ethereum]]
		- Despite scalability challenges, [[Ethereum]] maintains the largest [[NFT]] ecosystem. [[Layer 2 solutions]] like [[Optimism]] and [[Arbitrum]] provide improved [[Scalability]].
	- #### [[Alternative layer 1 blockchains]]
		- [[Solana]]: Fast and cheap, but [[Centralized]]. [[Solana]] suffered from the [[FTX]] exchange collapse, affecting [[Asset]] confidence.
		- [[Cardano]]: Offers technical improvements but faces [[Network effects]] challenges.
	- #### [[Peerswap]]
		- [[Submarine swaps]] and [[Liquidity rebalancing]] protocols enable asset transfer between [[Liquid]] and other [[Bitcoin]] layers. This is an active area of development in 2025.
	- #### [[FROST]] on [[Bitcoin]]
		- [[FROST]] (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold) enables [[Threshold signatures]] and multi-sig arrangements on [[Bitcoin]]. This allows [[Collaborative custody]] and [[Shared ownership]] of [[UTXO|UTXOs]].
	- #### [[Spacechains]]
		- [[Spacechains]] provide a clean method for [[Asset issuance]] using [[Bitcoin]] as the base layer. New [[Spacechains]] inherit [[Bitcoin's security]] through [[Mining]]. By 2025, spacechains are approaching [[Mainnet]] readiness.
	- #### [[RGB Protocol]]
		- [[RGB]] is a sophisticated [[Smart contract]] protocol for [[Bitcoin]] and [[Taproot]]. It enables [[Client-side validation]], [[Privacy]] through [[Zero-knowledge proofs]], and efficient [[Asset]] management. [[RGB]] is the planned solution for [[Digital objects]] requiring complex logic.
	- ##### [[BRC-20 tokens]]
		- [[BRC-20]] are [[Fungible tokens]] created by attaching [[JSON]] data to [[Satoshis]] through [[Bitcoin ordinals]]. The community is split on [[BRC-20]] usage and its impact on [[Bitcoin transaction fees]]. For [[Fungible assets]], [[BRC-20]] offers advantages over [[ERC-20]] in [[Simplicity]], [[Security]], and [[Fair minting processes]]. By 2025, [[BRC-20]] adoption has stabilized with clearer fee market dynamics.
	- ##### [[Litecoin]], [[Vertcoin]], and other chains
		- [[Bitcoin forks]] and [[Alternative networks]] can implement [[Ordinals]]-based [[Asset issuance]]. [[Litecoin]] serves as a [[Technical testbed]] for [[Bitcoin]] innovations. By 2025, multiple chains experiment with [[Inscription]] protocols and [[Digital artefacts]].
		- [Runes on Litecoin! : r/litecoin (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/1ckwnu6/runes_on_litecoin/)
	- #### [[Bitcoin Ordinals]], [[Inscriptions]], and [[RUNES]]
		- [[Bitcoin ordinals]] enable [[Digital artefact]] storage directly on the [[Bitcoin blockchain]], offering [[Security]], [[Immutability]], and [[Decentralization]]. The [[Taproot]] upgrade allows efficient [[Large file storage]] on [[Bitcoin]]. By 2025, ordinals have matured as a viable [[Asset]] protocol.
		- [[Digital artefacts]] represent a higher standard than traditional [[NFT|NFTs]]: they are [[Decentralized]], [[Immutable]], [[On-chain]], and [[Unrestricted]]. Unlike many [[NFT|NFTs]] with [[Off-chain storage]], ordinals provide complete [[On-chain]] [[Digital object]] integrity.
			- *[[Inscriptions]] are stored entirely on [[Bitcoin]], the oldest, most [[Decentralized]], most [[Secure blockchain]]. They require no [[Smart contract]] audits and represent true [[Digital artefacts]].*
		- [[Ordinals]] track individual [[Satoshis]] using [[Ordinal theory]], ascribing [[Non-fungible]] properties to [[Satoshis]]. [[Inscriptions]] can contain diverse [[Digital content]]: [[Images]], [[Audio]], [[Video]], [[PDFs]], and even [[Interactive content]]. Ownership is transferred by spending the [[UTXO]] containing the [[Satoshi]], not the data itself, which remains linked to the original ordinal.
		- The [[Bitcoin]] community has debated [[Ordinals]] usage and its impact on [[Block space utilization]]. [[Inscription]] costs are measured in [[Satoshis]] per byte. By 2025, fee market dynamics have adjusted to accommodate [[Ordinals]] and other [[Bitcoin data protocols]].
		- Case studies of [[Digital artefact migration]] between blockchains raise important questions about [[Ownership]] rights, [[IP]] retention, and [[Legal frameworks]] for [[Digital objects]]. The relationship between [[NFT]] holders and [[Smart contracts]] is still evolving.
		- [[Blockchain scalability]] considerations impact [[Ordinals]] viability. [[Pruned nodes]] and [[Archival nodes]] allow participation at different [[Data storage]] levels. By 2025, [[Node infrastructure]] has evolved to accommodate larger blockchain sizes. [[Lightning Network]] provides scalability solutions.
		- There is also likely to be a considerable impact on the size of the **full** Bitcoin blockchain where the approach to become commonplace. What was a 500 gigabyte file with a fairly linear growth rate might likely become many terabytes over the coming years. The overall workaround for this would be ‘pruned nodes’ vs ‘archival nodes’, similar to the Ethereum approach, with those likely only run in places where prosecutions for illegal data on the chain seem unlikely. Curiously this won’t effect users of the system who choose to run their own nodes, asthe software is configured to throw away this extraneous data prior to the timestamp of the last software upgrade. Concerns that this might price out participation from emerging markets are overblown from an infrastructure point of view, but potentially valid from a fee competition standpoint. This perhaps drives Lightning adoption. Nobody seems too sure, though Kaloudis, senior researcher at Coindesk describes the tradeoffs and tensions at this time.[[Kaloudis2023]] As seems to be the norm now, there is [Nostr integration](https://nosft.xyz/) coming to Ordinals.
		- [[Major NFT projects]] like [[Yuga Labs]] have moved into the [[Bitcoin ordinals]] space by 2025. This demonstrates the [[Migration]] of established [[NFT]] projects to [[Bitcoin-based]] models, emphasising [[Self-custody]] and [[True ownership]] principles.
		- [[PSBT|Partially signed Bitcoin transactions (PSBTs)]] enable [[Collaborative Bitcoin]] transactions. By 2025, [[PSBT]] support has expanded, facilitating [[Multi-sig]] arrangements and enabling [[Secure ordinal transfer]].
		- [[Bitcoin ordinal wallets]] like [[Unisat]] provide browser-based access to [[BRC-20]] tokens and [[NFT|NFTs]]. By 2025, wallet infrastructure has matured to support both [[Fungible]] and [[Non-fungible]] [[Digital assets]] on [[Bitcoin]].
		- For complex [[Metaverse]] use cases, [[RGB Protocol]] is the preferred solution, offering [[Privacy]] through [[Zero-knowledge proofs]], [[Client-side validation]], and [[Peer-to-peer verification]]. [[RGB]] provides the [[Smart contract]] sophistication needed for advanced [[Digital objects]].
		- [[RUNES]], created by [[Rodarmor]], enable [[Fungible token]] issuance on [[Bitcoin]]. This represents an evolution from [[Ordinals]] for [[Fungible assets]]. By 2025, [[RUNES]] have become a significant part of the [[Bitcoin]] asset ecosystem, with implications for [[Transaction fees]].
