## Recurrent Neural Network

Recurrent Neural Network refers to ### Primary Definition

- A **[[Recurrent Neural Network]] (RNN)** is a [[neural network]] architecture featuring feedback connections that enable the processing of sequential data by maintaining [[hidden state]] across time steps.
- Unlike [[feedforward neural networks]], RNNs can capture temporal dependencies and process variable-length sequences through recurrent connections that create internal memory.
- **Core Characteristics**:
	- **Temporal processing**: Processes sequences one element at a time
	- **Internal memory**: Maintains [[hidden state]] across time steps
	- **Parameter sharing**: Same weights applied across all time steps
	- **Variable-length input**: Can handle sequences of arbitrary length
	- **Sequential dependencies**: Captures temporal relationships in data

## Blockchain Relevance Assessment [Updated 2025]

### Domain Classification

- **Primary Domain**: [[Machine Learning Domain]] / [[Artificial Intelligence Domain]]
- **Blockchain Relevance**: **MINIMAL TO NONE**

### Analysis

- **Core Technology**: RNNs are pure neural network architectures for sequential data processing
- **Primary Applications**: NLP, speech recognition, time series prediction - unrelated to distributed ledger technology
- **Standards**: ISO/IEC 22989 (AI terminology) and NIST AI RMF - no blockchain standards
- **Research Community**: Machine learning and deep learning - distinct from blockchain/distributed systems research

### Potential Cross-Domain Applications (Peripheral)

- **Smart Contract Auditing**: Analyzing code sequences for vulnerability detection (minimal RNN use)
- **Blockchain Anomaly Detection**: Time-series analysis of transaction patterns (limited deployment)
- **Cryptocurrency Price Prediction**: Financial forecasting (speculative application, not core blockchain technology)

### Recommendation

- **RELOCATION RECOMMENDED**: This content belongs in a dedicated **[[AI/ML Knowledge Graph]]** or **[[Deep Learning Knowledge Graph]]**
