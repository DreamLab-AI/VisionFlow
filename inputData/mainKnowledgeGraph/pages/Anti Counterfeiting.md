## Anti Counterfeiting

Anti Counterfeiting refers to blockchain-based systems employing cryptographic verification, immutable ledgers, and physical-digital integration technologies (nfc tags, qr codes, rfid) to authenticate products, prevent counterfeiting, and establish verifiable supply chain provenance across pharmaceuticals, luxury goods, electronics, and consumer products.

- Blockchain-based anti-counterfeiting represents a paradigm shift from centralised authentication systems
  - Traditional methods (barcodes, holograms, RFID tags) have proven increasingly vulnerable to manipulation and duplication
  - Decentralised ledger technology offers tamper-proof product records and end-to-end supply chain transparency
  - Game-theoretic analysis reveals nuanced trade-offs between technological adoption and pricing mechanisms
  - The field bridges cryptography, supply chain management, and consumer trust architecture

## Current Landscape (2025)

- Industry adoption and market dynamics
  - Global anti-counterfeiting packaging market valued at USD 173.79 billion in 2024, projected to reach USD 408.83 billion by 2032 (approximately 12.6% CAGR)
  - Asia Pacific region experiencing accelerated growth: USD 44.34 billion (2024) to USD 107.65 billion (2032)
  - Counterfeiting remains a critical challenge: WHO estimates 1 in 10 medicines in low and middle-income countries are substandard or falsified
  - US Customs and Border Protection intercepted nearly 1.3 billion parcels in 2024 flagged for counterfeit pharmaceuticals
  - Pharmaceutical counterfeiting alone represents approximately USD 75 billion in annual criminal enterprise value
  - Operation Pangea XVI (Interpol-led, 90 countries) resulted in 769 arrests and seizure of 50.4 million counterfeit medicine doses
- Technical capabilities and implementation approaches
  - Blockchain records immutable product lifecycle data, enabling consumer verification via QR codes and NFC tags
  - Integration with Internet of Things (IoT) sensors monitors real-time conditions (temperature, humidity, location) during transit—particularly critical for pharmaceuticals and perishables
  - Cryptographic verification ensures authenticity without reliance on centralised authorities
  - Physical-digital integration combines traditional identifiers with distributed ledger verification
  - Enterprise blockchain combined with IoT creates cost-efficient supply chain transparency foundations
- Limitations and strategic considerations
  - Blockchain adoption is not universally advantageous; brand firms may occasionally prefer pricing mechanisms even when implementation costs are negligible
  - Technology does not invariably increase consumer surplus or social welfare across all stakeholder groups
  - Counterfeiter profits consistently reduce under blockchain implementation, but outcomes for consumers and society remain parameter-dependent
  - Win-win-win scenarios (benefiting brand firms, consumers, and society simultaneously) require favourable parameter ranges
  - Higher-quality counterfeits may paradoxically harm counterfeiters whilst benefiting legitimate brand firms
- Standards and frameworks
  - No universally mandated international standard currently exists; implementation varies by industry sector and jurisdiction
  - Pharmaceutical sector increasingly adopts blockchain for serialisation and track-and-trace compliance
  - Luxury goods market leverages blockchain for provenance verification and consumer confidence
  - Food and beverage sector utilises blockchain for origin claims verification (organic certification, fair trade, conflict-free sourcing)
