## Key Characteristics

### Dimensions of Safety

#### 1. Physical Safety

**Definition**: Prevention of bodily harm or injury

**Examples**:
- Autonomous vehicle collision avoidance
- Surgical robot preventing tissue damage
- Industrial robot not striking workers

**Measures**:
- Injury severity classifications (ISO 26262)
- Safe state achievement
- Emergency stop effectiveness

#### 2. Operational Safety

**Definition**: Safe system behaviour during normal operation

**Examples**:
- Medical AI not recommending harmful treatments
- Content moderation preventing harmful content
- Financial AI not causing market instability

**Measures**:
- Error rate on safety-critical tasks
- False negative rate (missed hazards)
- Time to safe state

#### 3. Societal Safety

**Definition**: Prevention of large-scale societal harms

**Examples**:
- AI weapons avoiding civilian casualties
- Social media AI preventing radicalization
- Misinformation detection systems

**Measures**:
- Population-level impact assessments
- Bias and fairness metrics
- Long-term consequence evaluation

## Safety Principles

### 1. Prevention over Mitigation

**Principle**: Eliminate hazards at source rather than managing consequences

**Example**: Design autonomous vehicle to avoid situations requiring emergency braking, not just improve braking

### 2. Fail-Safe Design

**Principle**: System enters safe state upon failure

**Example**: Robot stops moving if sensor fails, rather than continuing with corrupted data

### 3. Defence in Depth

**Principle**: Multiple independent safety barriers

**Example**: Autonomous vehicle has:
- Perception redundancy (camera + lidar + radar)
- Planning verification
- Emergency override
- Mechanical brakes

### 4. Human Oversight

**Principle**: Meaningful human control over safety-critical functions

**Example**: Lethal autonomous weapons require human authorization to engage

## Safety Hazards in AI Systems

   - **Example**: Robot takes shortest path, trampling garden
   - **Mitigation**: Impact regularization, explicit constraints

3. **Distributional Shift**

   - **Example**: Autonomous vehicle trained in clear weather fails in snow
   - **Mitigation**: Robust training, OOD detection

### Robustness Hazards

4. **Adversarial Examples**

   - Compromised training data causes unsafe behaviour
   - **Example**: Poisoned medical training data leads to harmful diagnoses
   - **Mitigation**: Data provenance, anomaly detection
