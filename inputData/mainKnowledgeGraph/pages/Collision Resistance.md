## Collision Resistance

Collision Resistance refers to hash function security property within blockchain systems, providing essential functionality for distributed ledger technology operations and properties.

- Collision resistance remains critical in industry, especially in financial technology, cybersecurity, and blockchain platforms.
  - Organisations such as major UK banks and fintech firms in London and Manchester rely on collision-resistant hashes to secure transactions.
  - Blockchain projects in Leeds and Newcastle increasingly adopt SHA-3 and other advanced hash functions to mitigate vulnerabilities found in older algorithms like MD5 and SHA-1.
- Technical capabilities have improved with newer hash functions offering stronger collision resistance, though the "birthday paradox" still sets theoretical limits on collision resistance based on output size.
- Standards such as NIST SP 800-107 Rev. 1 continue to guide secure hash function design and evaluation, emphasising collision resistance as a key criterion.
