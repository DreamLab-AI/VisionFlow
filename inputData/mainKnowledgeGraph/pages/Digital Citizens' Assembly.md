## Academic Context

- Digital Citizens' Assemblies represent an evolution of traditional citizens' assemblies, integrating extended reality (XR) environments to facilitate structured, multi-agent democratic deliberation and policy co-creation.
  - These assemblies build on the foundational principles of deliberative democracy, where randomly selected participants engage in informed discussion to produce collective recommendations.
  - The academic foundations draw from political theory on deliberative democracy (e.g., Dryzek, 2000), digital governance, and human-computer interaction, particularly in immersive and collaborative virtual spaces.

## Current Landscape (2025)

- Industry adoption has expanded beyond experimental pilots to more sustained implementations leveraging XR technologies for democratic engagement.
  - Notable platforms include global initiatives like the Global Citizens’ Assembly, which integrates thousands of local assemblies feeding into international policy discussions, particularly on climate governance[1][6][7].
  - AI-assisted deliberation tools are increasingly used to lower barriers to participation, improve inclusivity, and enhance the quality of contributions without replacing in-person dialogue[3].
- In the UK, digital citizens' assemblies have been trialled in various local government contexts, with a growing interest in hybrid models combining face-to-face and digital participation to maximise reach and depth[4].
- Technical capabilities now support multilingual, asynchronous deliberation in XR spaces, though challenges remain in ensuring equitable access, mitigating digital divides, and maintaining deliberative quality.
- Emerging standards and frameworks focus on transparency, representativeness, balanced evidence presentation, and participant support to uphold democratic legitimacy[4].

## UK Context

- The UK has been a fertile ground for digital citizens' assemblies, with local authorities in Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield experimenting with hybrid deliberative formats that combine XR and traditional methods.
  - Manchester’s civic innovation labs have piloted XR-enabled assemblies focusing on urban planning and climate resilience.
  - Leeds and Sheffield have integrated AI tools to support participant engagement and summarise deliberations.
  - Newcastle has emphasised inclusivity by partnering with community organisations to bridge digital access gaps.
- British academic institutions contribute to the theoretical and practical development of these assemblies, often collaborating with civil society and government bodies.
- The UK’s digital governance strategies increasingly recognise the value of such assemblies for enhancing democratic legitimacy and citizen empowerment.

## Future Directions

- Emerging trends include:
  - Greater integration of AI to personalise information delivery and facilitate consensus-building without supplanting human judgement.
  - Expansion of XR capabilities to support more immersive, accessible, and emotionally engaging deliberative experiences.
  - Development of interoperable platforms to connect local, national, and global assemblies, fostering multi-scalar democratic dialogue.
- Anticipated challenges:
  - Ensuring digital equity to prevent exclusion of less tech-savvy or resource-poor populations.
  - Maintaining deliberative integrity amid potential manipulation or misinformation.
  - Balancing technological innovation with the preservation of human-centric democratic values.
- Research priorities focus on longitudinal impacts of digital assemblies on policy outcomes, participant empowerment, and democratic renewal.
