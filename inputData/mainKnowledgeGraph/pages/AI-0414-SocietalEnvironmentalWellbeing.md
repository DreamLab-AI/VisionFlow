  - **Definition**
    - definition:: Societal and Environmental Wellbeing is a trustworthiness dimension ensuring AI systems consider broader impacts on communities, environment, democratic processes, and human flourishing beyond immediate functional objectives, promoting sustainable development and social cohesion. This dimension encompasses four core components: environmental sustainability (measuring and minimizing energy consumption and carbon footprint throughout AI lifecycle including training and inference, implementing resource efficiency through techniques like model pruning, quantization, and distillation reducing computational requirements, supporting circular economy principles through hardware reuse and responsible disposal, and utilizing renewable energy sources and carbon-aware scheduling), social impact assessment (evaluating employment effects including job displacement risks, transformation of work roles, and creation of new opportunities, assessing skills impact and reskilling requirements as automation changes workforce needs, evaluating democratic impact on civic participation, information ecosystems, and governance processes, and considering social cohesion effects on community bonds, inequality, and societal polarization), societal benefit and contribution (aligning with public good objectives including health, education, and environmental protection, promoting human flourishing through capabilities enhancement and wellbeing improvement, and contributing to UN Sustainable Development Goals including SDG 3 health, SDG 4 education, SDG 5 gender equality, SDG 8 decent work, SDG 9 innovation, SDG 10 reduced inequalities, SDG 11 sustainable cities, SDG 12 responsible consumption, SDG 13 climate action, SDG 16 peace and justice, and SDG 17 partnerships), and accountability mechanisms (ensuring auditability through comprehensive documentation enabling external review, implementing risk management processes identifying and mitigating potential harms, providing redress mechanisms enabling affected parties to contest decisions, and assigning clear responsibility for outcomes to accountable parties). The 2024-2025 period witnessed environmental impact become critical concern as data centers consumed approximately 415 TWh in 2024 with projections to reach 945 TWh by 2030, generative AI training clusters consuming seven to eight times more energy than typical workloads, spurring Green AI movement emphasizing algorithmic efficiency, energy-efficient hardware, and training optimization, while corporate leaders like Google demonstrated viability of efficiency gains reducing data center emissions 12% despite 27% electricity consumption increase through delivering six times more computing power per unit electricity than five years prior, and U.S. lawmakers introduced Artificial Intelligence Environmental Impacts Act directing EPA environmental footprint studies.
