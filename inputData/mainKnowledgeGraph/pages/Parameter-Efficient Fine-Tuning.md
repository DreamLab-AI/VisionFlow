## Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning

Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning refers to training techniques that update only a small subset of model parameters during fine-tuning, reducing computational and memory requirements whilst maintaining comparable performance to full fine-tuning. peft methods enable adaptation of large models with limited resources.

- PEFT has become a mainstream approach in industry for adapting large language models (LLMs) and other AI models, enabling faster, cheaper, and more resource-efficient fine-tuning.
  - Notable methods include Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which injects low-rank trainable matrices into transformer layers, and its quantized variant QLoRA, which further reduces storage needs[6].
  - PEFT typically updates between 1% to 10% of model parameters, drastically cutting training time and hardware demands while preserving model quality[3].
- Organisations across sectors use PEFT to tailor large models to specific domains, languages, or customer needs without incurring the prohibitive costs of full fine-tuning.
- In the UK, and particularly in North England, AI research hubs and tech companies in Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield increasingly adopt PEFT to develop domain-specific AI solutions.
  - These centres leverage PEFT to overcome local infrastructure constraints and accelerate AI deployment in healthcare, finance, and manufacturing.
- Despite its advantages, PEFT involves trade-offs: fully fine-tuned models may offer marginally better performance and more control, but PEFT is preferred when computational resources or data are limited[6].
- Standards and frameworks for PEFT are evolving, with growing emphasis on interoperability, reproducibility, and benchmarking across different model architectures and tasks.

## UK Context

- The UK has made significant contributions to PEFT research and application, with universities and companies actively publishing and deploying PEFT techniques.
- North England’s innovation hubs in Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield play a pivotal role in advancing PEFT-driven AI solutions.
  - For example, Manchester’s AI research centres focus on healthcare applications, using PEFT to adapt large models for medical imaging and diagnostics with limited computational budgets.
  - Leeds and Sheffield have seen startups employing PEFT to customise language models for legal and financial sectors, enabling cost-effective AI adoption.
  - Newcastle’s tech ecosystem supports PEFT in manufacturing and industrial automation, where resource constraints are common.
- These regional efforts demonstrate how PEFT enables AI democratisation by lowering barriers to entry for organisations outside London’s traditional tech cluster.

## Future Directions

- Emerging trends include:
  - Integration of PEFT with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and instruction tuning to improve model alignment and usability[6].
  - Development of hybrid PEFT methods combining additive and selective parameter updates for optimal efficiency and performance.
  - Expansion of PEFT to support multi-task and multi-modal learning scenarios.
- Anticipated challenges:
  - Balancing the trade-off between parameter efficiency and model control or interpretability.
  - Establishing robust evaluation benchmarks that reflect real-world deployment constraints.
  - Addressing security and privacy concerns when fine-tuning models on sensitive or proprietary data.
- Research priorities focus on:
  - Enhancing the adaptability of PEFT methods to diverse architectures and domains.
  - Reducing the carbon footprint of fine-tuning large models.
  - Facilitating wider adoption through open-source tools and standardised protocols.
