## Preference Learning

Preference Learning refers to a machine learning paradigm that learns from comparative judgments (e.g., "a is better than b") rather than absolute labels or demonstrations. preference learning enables training models to align with human values by learning from rankings and comparisons, which are often easier for humans to provide than absolute ratings or demonstrations.

- Preference learning has seen increasing adoption in personalised recommendation systems, virtual assistants, and human-aligned AI models.
  - Notable implementations include training large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and LLaMA 3.2 using reinforcement learning from human preferences to better align outputs with user expectations[2].
  - Industry platforms leverage preference learning to enhance user experience by predicting and adapting to subjective tastes, particularly in e-commerce and content curation.
- In the UK, and specifically in North England, AI research hubs in Manchester and Leeds have contributed to advancing preference learning techniques, often focusing on human-computer interaction and ethical AI alignment.
- Technical capabilities:
  - Preference learning algorithms efficiently handle subjective, context-dependent data, often requiring fewer explicit labels but more nuanced comparative feedback.
  - Limitations include the need for high-quality preference data and challenges in scaling to complex, multi-dimensional preference spaces.
- Standards and frameworks for preference learning are emerging, emphasising transparency, fairness, and interpretability in preference-based models[3][6].
