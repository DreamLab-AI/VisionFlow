	- definition:: The process of adapting a pre-trained model to a specific downstream task by continuing training on task-specific data, typically with a lower learning rate. Fine-tuning leverages knowledge acquired during pre-training whilst specialising the model for particular applications.

## Academic Context

Fine-tuning emerged as a foundational technique in transfer learning, enabling pre-trained models to achieve strong performance on specific tasks with relatively little task-specific data. This approach forms the basis of modern large language model adaptation strategies.

**Primary Source**: Multiple sources; comprehensive survey in arXiv:2411.01195 (2024)

## Key Characteristics

- Continues training from pre-trained weights
- Uses lower learning rates than pre-training
- Requires task-specific labelled data
- Adapts general knowledge to specific domains
- Can update all or subset of model parameters

## Technical Details

**Process**:
1. Load pre-trained model weights
2. Replace or add task-specific output layers
3. Train on task-specific dataset
4. Use reduced learning rate to prevent catastrophic forgetting

**Variants**:
- Full fine-tuning (updates all parameters)
- Layer-wise fine-tuning (selective layer updates)
- Gradual unfreezing (progressive layer training)

## Usage in AI/ML

"Fine-tuning allows pre-trained models to achieve strong performance on specific tasks with relatively little task-specific data."

Common applications:
- Domain adaptation (general → specialised)
- Task specialisation (language understanding → question answering)
- Multi-task learning scenarios
- Transfer across related domains

## Related Concepts

- **Pre-Training**: Initial training phase providing general representations
- **Transfer Learning**: Broader paradigm of knowledge transfer
- **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**: Methods updating fewer parameters
- **Domain Adaptation**: Specialisation for specific application domains
- **Catastrophic Forgetting**: Risk during fine-tuning process

## Historical Development

- Early neural networks: Task-specific training from scratch
- 2018: BERT demonstrates power of pre-train-then-fine-tune
- 2019-2020: Fine-tuning becomes standard practice
- 2021+: Parameter-efficient methods gain prominence
- 2023+: Instruction tuning and alignment fine-tuning

## Significance

Fine-tuning democratised access to state-of-the-art model performance by enabling effective task adaptation without massive computational resources required for pre-training from scratch.
