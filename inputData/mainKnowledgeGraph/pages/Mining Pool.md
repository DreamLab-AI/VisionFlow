## Mining Pool

Mining Pool refers to collaborative mining group within blockchain systems, providing essential functionality for distributed ledger technology operations and properties.

- **Pool Mining Process**
  1. **Registration**: [[Miner]] creates account with pool, receives unique worker credentials
  2. **Connection**: [[Miner]] connects [[ASIC]] hardware to pool via [[Stratum protocol]]
  3. **Work Distribution**: Pool server sends [[block template]] with assigned [[nonce]] ranges
  4. **Share Submission**: [[Miner]] submits valid [[shares]] (partial proofs-of-work) to pool
  5. **Block Discovery**: When pool finds valid [[block]], broadcasts to [[Bitcoin network]]
  6. **Reward Distribution**: Pool distributes [[block reward]] based on submitted [[shares]]
  -
- **Share System**
  - **What are Shares?**: Partial [[proof-of-work]] solutions that don't meet full [[Bitcoin]] [[difficulty]] but prove [[miner]] is working
  - **Difficulty Adjustment**: Pool sets share [[difficulty]] lower than network [[difficulty]] (e.g., 1/10,000th)
  - **Validation**: Pool server validates each share to prevent cheating
  - **Accounting**: Shares track each [[miner]]'s proportional contribution to pool's total [[hash rate]]
  -
- **[[Stratum Protocol]]**
  - **Purpose**: Efficient communication between [[miners]] and pool servers
  - **Features**:
    - Lightweight JSON-RPC protocol over TCP
    - [[Difficulty]] adjustment per [[miner]]
    - Job notifications for new [[blocks]]
    - Share submission and validation
  - **Limitations**: Pool controls [[block template]], creating centralization

## Pool Reward Schemes

- **[[PPLNS]] (Pay Per Last N Shares)**
  - **Mechanism**: Rewards distributed based on last N [[shares]] when [[block]] is found
  - **Variance**: Higher variance, rewards depend on pool's luck
  - **Loyalty**: Discourages [[pool hopping]], rewards consistent [[miners]]
  - **Typical N**: Last 5-10 times [[difficulty]] worth of [[shares]]
  - **Pros**: No risk for pool operator, fair long-term distribution
  - **Cons**: More variance for [[miners]], delayed first payment
  -
- **[[PPS]] (Pay Per Share)**
  - **Mechanism**: Fixed payment per valid [[share]], regardless of [[block]] discovery
  - **Variance**: Zero variance for [[miners]], pool assumes all risk
  - **Payment**: Instant payment based on expected [[block]] reward value
  - **Fees**: Higher fees (2-4%) due to pool's financial risk
  - **Pros**: Completely predictable income for [[miners]]
  - **Cons**: Higher fees, pool bankruptcy risk during bad luck
  -
- **[[PPS+]] (Pay Per Share Plus)**
  - **Mechanism**: [[PPS]] for [[block reward]], [[PPLNS]] for [[transaction fees]]
  - **Balance**: Lower pool risk while sharing [[transaction fee]] upside
  - **Typical Fees**: 1.5-3%
  - **Popular**: Used by [[Foundry USA]], [[F2Pool]], [[ViaBTC]]
  -
- **[[FPPS]] (Full Pay Per Share)**
  - **Mechanism**: [[PPS]] for both [[block reward]] and [[transaction fees]]
  - **Variance**: Completely predictable, pool assumes maximum risk
  - **Fees**: Highest fees (2.5-4%)
  - **Usage**: Preferred by large [[mining farms]] needing stable revenue
  -

  -

## Mining Pool Economics

- **Variance Reduction**
  - **Solo Mining Variance**: Individual [[miner]] with 0.01% of network [[hash rate]] expects [[block]] every ~694 days
  - **Pool Mining Variance**: Same [[miner]] in pool receives proportional rewards daily
  - **Statistical Impact**: Pool reduces payout variance by 1,000-10,000x
  - **Business Value**: Enables predictable revenue for operational planning
  -
- **Fee Structures**
  - **Typical Fees**:
    - [[PPLNS]]: 0.5-2%
    - [[PPS]]: 2-4%
    - [[PPS+]]: 1.5-3%
    - [[FPPS]]: 2.5-4%
  - **Fee Justification**: Infrastructure costs, payment processing, pool operator risk
  - **Competitive Pressure**: Fees have decreased over time due to competition
  -
- **Profitability Comparison**
  - **Example**: 100 TH/s [[miner]] at $0.05/kWh electricity, 3,000W consumption
    - **Solo Mining**: Expected revenue ~$8/day, actual variance ±100%
    - **Pool Mining ([[PPS+]])**: Guaranteed $7.76/day (2% fee), zero variance
    - **Net Benefit**: $3.60/day electricity cost → ~$4.16/day profit (pool)
  -

## Centralization Concerns

- **[[51% Attack]] Risk**
  - **Threat**: Pool controlling >50% [[hash rate]] could execute [[double-spend attacks]]
  - **Historical Events**:
    - **2014**: [[GHash.IO]] briefly exceeded 50%, voluntarily reduced
    - **2025**: Top 3 pools ([[Foundry USA]], [[AntPool]], [[F2Pool]]) control ~70%
  - **Mitigation**: [[Miners]] can switch pools instantly, economic disincentives
  -
- **Geographic Concentration**
  - **Historical Issue**: Pre-2021, ~65% [[hash rate]] in China
  - **2021 China Ban**: Forced migration, now ~40% in North America, 20% Kazakhstan
  - **Current Distribution (2025)**:
    - United States: ~40%
    - China: ~15% (despite ban)
    - Kazakhstan: ~18%
    - Russia: ~11%
    - Other: ~16%
  -
- **[[Transaction]] Censorship**
  - **Risk**: Pools could refuse to include specific [[transactions]]
  - **Examples**: [[MARA Pool]] briefly filtered [[OFAC]]-sanctioned addresses (2023)
  - **[[Stratum V2]] Solution**: Allows [[miners]] to construct own [[block templates]]
  -

## Solo Mining vs Pool Mining

- **Solo Mining**
  - **Pros**:
    - No pool fees (keep 100% of [[block reward]])
    - Complete control over [[transaction]] selection
    - Maximum [[decentralization]]
  - **Cons**:
    - Extreme variance (months/years between payouts)
    - Unpredictable revenue stream
    - Requires significant [[hash rate]] for viability
  - **Viable For**: Large [[mining farms]] with >1% network [[hash rate]]
  -
- **Pool Mining**
  - **Pros**:
    - Predictable, consistent revenue
    - Lower variance enables business planning
    - Professional infrastructure and support
  - **Cons**:
    - Pool fees reduce net revenue
    - Less control over [[transaction]] inclusion
    - Contributes to [[centralization]]
  - **Viable For**: 99%+ of [[miners]], especially small operations
  -

## Pool Hopping & Countermeasures

- **[[Pool Hopping]]**
  - **Definition**: Strategy of switching between pools to exploit reward scheme weaknesses
  - **Vulnerable Schemes**: Proportional, early [[PPLNS]] variants
  - **Mechanism**: Join pool early in round, leave before [[block]] found
  - **Impact**: Honest [[miners]] earn less, pool reputation damaged
  -
- **Countermeasures**
  - **[[PPLNS]]**: Hopping-resistant by design, rewards consistent [[miners]]
  - **Score-Based**: Weight recent [[shares]] higher than old [[shares]]
  - **Minimum Payout**: Requires minimum [[shares]] before first payment
  - **Detection**: Pools monitor for suspicious switching patterns
  -

## Academic Context

- [[Mining pools]] are collaborative networks where individual [[cryptocurrency]] [[miners]] combine [[computational resources]] to increase the probability of successfully mining new [[blocks]] on a [[blockchain]].
  - This collective approach emerged as a response to the increasing [[difficulty]] of [[mining]] puzzles, which made [[solo mining]] increasingly impractical after [[Bitcoin]]'s early years.
  - The foundational academic understanding of [[mining pools]] is grounded in [[distributed computing]], [[game theory]], and [[cryptographic]] [[consensus mechanisms]], particularly [[proof-of-work]] (PoW).
  - Early research highlighted the trade-offs between [[decentralization]] and efficiency, with [[mining pools]] offering more consistent rewards but raising concerns about [[centralization]] risks.
  -
- **Key Academic Research Areas**
  - **[[Selfish Mining]]**: Eyal & Sirer (2014) demonstrated that pools can gain advantages by strategically withholding [[blocks]]
  - **[[Block Withholding]] Attacks**: Courtois & Bahack (2014) analysed sabotage strategies in [[mining pools]]
  - **Reward Scheme Analysis**: Mathematical proofs of [[PPLNS]], [[PPS]], and variant properties
  - **[[Centralization]] Metrics**: Nakamoto coefficient and Gini coefficient for [[hash rate]] distribution
  - **[[Transaction Fee]] Markets**: Impact of pools on [[fee]] dynamics and [[mempool]] management
  -

## Current Landscape (2025)

- [[Mining pools]] remain a critical component of the [[cryptocurrency]] ecosystem, especially for [[PoW]] blockchains like [[Bitcoin]].
  - Approximately 10-15 major pools dominate [[Bitcoin]]'s network [[hashrate]], with entities such as [[Foundry USA]] and [[AntPool]] collectively controlling over 50% of [[mining]] power.
  - Pools assign discrete work units ([[nonces]]) to [[miners]], who contribute [[hash power]] to solve [[cryptographic]] puzzles; rewards are distributed proportionally based on contributed computational effort via the [[share]] system.
