## Archival Node

Archival Node refers to complete history storage node within blockchain systems, providing essential functionality for distributed ledger technology operations and properties.

- Archival nodes are widely adopted in blockchain ecosystems that require detailed historical data access, notably Ethereum and other smart contract platforms.
  - They are critical for developers, researchers, and enterprises needing to reconstruct past states or perform complex queries without recomputing from genesis.
- Notable organisations and platforms providing archival node access include NOWNodes, QuickNode, and various blockchain infrastructure providers offering managed services to avoid the high resource costs of self-hosting.
- In the UK, blockchain infrastructure providers increasingly offer archival node services, supporting fintech, regulatory technology, and academic research.
  - North England cities such as Manchester and Leeds are emerging as innovation hubs for blockchain analytics and infrastructure, with startups and universities collaborating on decentralised data solutions.
- Technical capabilities:
  - Archive nodes require substantial disk space (often multiple terabytes), high bandwidth, and powerful hardware.
  - Synchronisation times are longer compared to full or light nodes.
  - They enable queries on any historical blockchain state, unlike full nodes which only track recent states.
- Limitations include high operational costs and complexity, making them unsuitable for lightweight applications.
- Standards and frameworks:
  - Ethereum’s node software (e.g., Geth, OpenEthereum) supports archival mode.
  - Industry standards for node interoperability and data query APIs continue to evolve, with emphasis on optimising archival data access.
