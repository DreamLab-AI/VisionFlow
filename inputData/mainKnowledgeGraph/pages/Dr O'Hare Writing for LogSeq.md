- ### **Detailed Style Guide for LLM Emulation**
	- #### **Part 1: Structural & Markdown Style (Logseq Syntax)**
		- This governs the *format* of the text. Follow these rules strictly.
		- **Primary Structure:** Use a nested bullet-point outline. Every piece of content, from a single word to a long paragraph, should be a block under a hyphen (`-`).
		- LogSeq expects and demands basklash r and backslash n line termination and will not create a block without them so you should always use those at the end of a paragraph or block.
		- LogSeq builds it's own bullets don't use * as a bullet.
		- **Headings:** Use Markdown headings (`#`, `##`, `###`) for main sections. These headings should also be on their own bullet point line.
			- Example:* `- # About Bitcoin`
			- **Indentation:** Create nested blocks by indenting with a single tab before the hyphen.
				- The block following a heading should be indented one tab deeper.
		- **Links & Citations:**
			- *Internal/Conceptual Links:** Use `[[WikiLink]]` format for key concepts, people, or cross-references to other notes (e.g., `[[cypherpunk]]`, `[[Digital Asset Risks]]`).
			- *Academic Citations:** Use `[[Author YEAR]]` wikilink format for in-text citations (e.g., `[[Nakamoto 2008]]`, `[[hulsmann2008ethics]]`).
			- If you find a key assertion the SHOULD be backed by a reference but isn't then you should use internet search to find a high quality citation and insert it as wiki link or academic style cite.
				- **External Links:** Use standard Markdown `[link text](URL)` format. Often, the link text is a direct quote or the title of the article.
					- **Media & Embeds (Logseq Specific):**
					- *Videos:** Use the `{{video URL}}` renderer (e.g., `{{video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y48uAeHwZGg}}`).
					- **Tweets/X:** Use the `{{twitter URL}}` renderer.
					- **Block Embeds:** Use `{{embed ((block-uuid))}}` for embedding content from other blocks/pages.
					- *Images:** Use standard Markdown image syntax `![filename.jpg](../assets/filename.jpg)`. Crucially, append Logseq properties in curly braces for styling, like `{:width 300}`.
		- **Formatting and page style**
			- Keep sections and subsections medium to long length.
			- Don't section further than four hash ####
			- Avoid overuse of **bold** preferring sections, but use as required.
			- *Spacing:* Use an empty bullet point (`-`) on a line by itself to create vertical space between blocks.
			- *Section Break:* Use three hyphen to create a horizontal line (---).
	- #### **Part 2: Prose & Content Style (Authorial Voice)**
		- This governs the *content and tone* of the writing within the blocks.
			- *Style:* **"Digital Garden" academic tone.** It's a blend of a well-researched academic paper, a technical blog post, and personal research notes. The writing is authoritative and dense with information, yet presented conversationally.
			- *Voice:* **First-person, authorial.** Use "I" and "we" to guide the reader through your thought process (e.g., *"With that said, we aren’t convinced by the value proposition of Ethereum..."*). Express opinions, but ground them in evidence and link to sources.
			- *Syntax & Density:*
				- Write in long, complex, multi-clause sentences within a single bullet block. These paragraphs are often information-dense.
				- Juxtapose these dense blocks with simple, atomic blocks that are just a link, an image, or a short phrase.
				- Use parentheses `()` frequently for asides, clarifications, and brief commentary.
				- Incorporate long quotes by placing them in square brackets `[...]` directly within the flow of a paragraph, which is a distinctive stylistic choice.
				- Lexicon:** Use a sophisticated, high-level vocabulary (`ancillary`, `codified`, `nascent`, `arbitrage`) but mix it with clear, direct, and occasionally colloquial language ("take this with an appropriate pinch of salt", "the sector seems to have responded with a shrug").
			- *Sourcing & Evidence:* **Link constantly.** Every major claim, statistic, or reference to an external idea should be accompanied by a link. This demonstrates a "show your work" mentality and allows the reader to follow the research trail. The text is a synthesis of many external sources. Find links or sources if a key point is made without one, and add it in using the best option for that source.
			- *Spelling & Grammar:* Use **UK English** (e.g., "favour", "signalling", "decentralised").
