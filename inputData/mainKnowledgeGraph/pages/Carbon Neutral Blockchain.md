## Carbon Neutral Blockchain

Carbon Neutral Blockchain refers to a component of the blockchain ecosystem.

- Industry adoption and implementations
	- Major blockchain platforms have transitioned to or launched carbon-neutral or carbon-negative networks, including Algorand (carbon negative), Ethereum (post-Proof-of-Stake), and several enterprise-focused chains
	- Carbon-neutral blockchains are increasingly adopted in sectors such as finance, supply chain, and energy, where environmental credentials are a competitive advantage
- Notable organisations and platforms
	- Algorand: Publicly carbon negative, with transparent reporting and third-party verification
	- Ethereum: Transitioned to Proof-of-Stake, reducing energy consumption by over 99% compared to its PoW era
	- Energy Web Foundation: Specialises in blockchain solutions for renewable energy and carbon tracking
- UK and North England examples where relevant
	- UK-based fintechs and energy startups are integrating carbon-neutral blockchains into their operations, particularly in Manchester and Leeds
	- The Energy Systems Catapult (Birmingham) and the Digital Catapult (Leeds) have supported pilot projects using blockchain for carbon accounting and renewable energy trading
	- Newcastle University’s Smart Grids and Energy Systems group has explored blockchain for local energy markets, with a focus on sustainability
- Technical capabilities and limitations
	- Carbon-neutral blockchains can achieve significant reductions in energy use and emissions, but residual impacts may remain from hardware manufacturing, network infrastructure, and indirect energy use
	- Carbon offsetting is often used to address residual emissions, but the credibility and permanence of offsets are subject to ongoing debate
	- Scalability and decentralisation remain challenges, as some energy-efficient consensus mechanisms trade off security or decentralisation for lower energy use
- Standards and frameworks
	- Industry standards for carbon-neutral blockchain are emerging, including the Crypto Climate Accord and the Blockchain for Climate Foundation’s guidelines
	- The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is developing standards for blockchain sustainability and carbon accounting
