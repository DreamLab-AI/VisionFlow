- The potential ecological footprint of the network has always been a concern; Hal Finney himself was [thinking about this issue](https://twitter.com/halfin/status/1153096538) with a mature Bitcoin network as early as 2009, and [a debate](https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/posts/bitcointalk/threads/167/#35) on the Bitcoin mailing lists called the mining process “thermodynamically perverse.” The most cited negative analysis on the matter by Mora et al. sees Bitcoin mining alone warming the planet above 2 degrees.[[mora2018bitcoin]]
- [Proponents of the technology](https://electricmoney.org/) say that the balance shifted dramatically in 2021 with China outright banning the technology; this has forced the bulk of the energy use [toward the USA](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E7489rM7Q62oXwk1f4NUlMvok9noAbpYfTynY2VTyww/edit#gid=0), and away from ‘dirty coal’.

- Some adherents [have proposed mitigations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N2N-5jY00cmteoY_puWI9oosM1foa4EQqsO1FFfIFR4/edit).[[cross2021greening]] As a worked example of [Cross and Bailey’s proposal](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15e_a-D3x4fv3tglEzFmQ6TLQx0fZe6-iKO9Fc9SyISQ/edit#gid=0) a retail investor owning 1 BTC would have to buy around 700 shares of ‘CleanSpark’ mining company (CLSK) to make their [holding completely neutral](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r32T8p_PHTP8S781u7PhPSwehLx2VcJTaJJKesMswD0/edit#gid=0). Some more strident voices suggest that [‘ending financialization’ through the use of Bitcoin](https://medium.com/@magusperivallon/a-financial-hail-mary-for-the-climate-an-argument-for-bitcoin-adoption-9c58e707d0) may be net positive for the environment at a macro level.[[bitcoinisvenice]] Indeed it may [provide a route](https://www.newsweek.com/bitcoin-mining-americas-most-misunderstood-industry-opinion-1669892) to support [electrifying everything](https://mobile.twitter.com/DSBatten/status/1514072998881665027) through deployment of [flexible demand load](https://lancium.com/solutions/). This enables a kind of [‘financial battery’](https://medium.com/@theendoftheworldpartyparty/deep-bitcarbonization-c8f483716ff7) that can soak up excess capacity from overbuilt renewables (something which needs to be done). Money-saving uses like [drying wood](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/09/can-bitcoin-be-sustainable-inside-the-norwegian-mine-that-also-dries-wood), and even heating greenhouses ([ironically tulips](https://www.euronews.com/next/2022/12/14/a-bitcoin-miner-and-tulip-grower-team-up-to-reduce-costs)) show the use case of the technology as a universal subsidy in heating applications.

### Experimental and Emerging Mining Technologies (2025)

Several innovative projects are using the financial incentive of [[Bitcoin]] to enable trials of new [[infrastructure]] and [[energy technologies]]:
**Novel Energy Sources:**
- [[Bhutan]] in the [[Himalayas]]: Has been secretly mining [[Bitcoin]] using [[hydroelectric power]] since 2019, revealed in 2023. Now plans a [$500M fund](https://www.straitstimes.com/business/bhutan-plans-a-500-million-fund-for-crypto-mining-in-the-himalayas) to expand [[Bitcoin mining]] capacity to 600 MW, representing 4% of national GDP. The [[Druk Holding & Investments]] (sovereign wealth fund) holds over $750M in [[Bitcoin]] as of 2025.^[Bhutan Bitcoin Mining Disclosure 2024]
- [[Makai Ocean Engineering]] + [[Oceanbit Hawaii]]: Piloting ['ocean thermal energy conversion' (OTEC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_thermal_energy_conversion) as a [[power source]] for the Hawaiian Islands. OTEC uses temperature differences between surface and deep ocean water to generate [[electricity]]. 5 MW pilot facility operational, with [[Bitcoin mining]] providing base load revenue while grid connection is developed.
- [[Vespene Energy]]: [[Methane capture]] from landfills and abandoned wells converted to [[Bitcoin mining]], preventing greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to planting 5 million trees per site per year.^[Vespene Energy Impact Assessment 2024]
**Regional Subsidy Programmes:**
Local [[subsidy]] initiatives driving adoption as seen in [[Texas]] (via [ERCOT demand response programmes](https://braiins.com/blog/bitcoin-mining-the-grid-generators))^[griffith2021electrify; @ercotimpact2021; @Menati2022] and [New Hampshire](https://www.governor.nh.gov/sites/g/files/ehbemt336/files/inline-documents/sonh/cryptocurrencie-report.pdf) (state commission recommending supportive regulatory framework). [[Brad Jones]], [CEO of ERCOT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKnRfDeFgr0), articulated this model in 2022 (see Grid Services section above).
	- “As we get more renewable generation, in particular wind, which is operating at night ... we have to find a home for it, otherwise we have to turn the wind down. It’s such a great resource we shouldn’t turn it down. Bitcoin mining, or what some call crypto, has found a way to come into our markets and take some of that wind in off-peak periods. Then when we get to peak period times, they are very quick to remove themselves from the market as prices increase. The fact that we can turn down whenever we need the power for other customers is fantastic. We can use that cryptocurrency to soak up that excess generation when there’s a lot of that, and find a home for more solar and more wind to come to our grid. Then they reduce consumption when we need that power for other customers. So it’s a great balancing act. Most other data centres (such as Microsoft or Amazon) have other customers to serve every other day, so they can’t just turn off. But these crypto customers can. If the cost of energy gets too high, they can remove themselves from the market. They are also helpful if we lose a generator. They can quickly respond to that frequency disruption and allow us to balance our grid.”  Flexible load balancing is entering the [mainstream news cycle](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemmagreen/2023/01/27/why-no-one-saw-the-success-of-demand-response-coming/?) and is gaining traction in legislative bodies. This [“global energy market revolution”](https://www.citadel21.com/bitcoin-is-the-first-global-market-for-electricity-and-will-unleash-renewables) is explained by Tabatabai of Modo Energy. Incredibly, Bitcoin mining in Texas is now making the grid both more reliable and cheaper for consumers. In the UK, we have similar problems because wind power is not evenly distributed, and moving it around is complex and expensive, and the whole system needs smoothing out with [gas plants](https://archy.deberker.com/the-uk-is-wasting-a-lot-of-wind-power/).
- There is growing interest and adoption of so-called [“stranded energy mining”](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-01/oman-backs-u-s-firm-mining-crypto-to-cut-natural-gas-flaring) which cannot be effectively transmitted to consumers, and is thereby sold at a huge discount while also [developing power capacity](https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wind-power/900mw-wind-farm-to-power-bitcoin-mining-operation/), without the [usual constraints](https://batcoinz.com/the-renewable-energy-cannot-happen-without-bitcoin-mining%ef%bf%bc/).[[bastian2021hedging]] One such example is [“Gridless” in Kenya](https://gridlesscompute.com/news/), which seeks to harness abundant green energy resources in rural areas with the hope of kick-starting economic growth. This feature of the network first came to popular attention in 2020 when Stevens, CEO of Stoneridge capital included the following text in a letter to shareholders within their [annual report](https://www.stoneridgefunds.com/documents/AnnualReport.pdf?v=4):“
	- "Bitcoin mining is the only profitable use of energy in human history that does not need to be located near human settlement to operate. The long-term implications of this are world-changing and hiding in plain sight.”

### Methane Capture and Carbon Reduction (2025)

In addition to new build, [[Bitcoin mining]] enables [re-purposing historic infrastructure](https://www.curbed.com/2021/07/crypto-currency-mining-old-power-plants.html) and [reducing carbon footprint](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-24/exxon-considers-taking-gas-to-bitcoin-pilot-to-four-countries) - or more significantly, [reducing methane emissions](https://batcoinz.com/quantifying-the-potential-impact-of-bitcoin-mining-on-global-methane-emissions-4/) from existing and [abandoned infrastructure](https://www.axios.com/2023/01/27/crypto-mining-advocate-green-abandoned-gas-wells).
**Institutional Recognition:**
- The [World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/videos/this-start-up-catches-waste-methane-to-power-data-centres) featured [[methane capture]] [[Bitcoin mining]] as climate solution
- UK's Department for Energy [expressed interest](https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/a99aa482-c7d1-4ec4-82fe-5c4b16827a6d) in [[methane capture]] applications for [[Bitcoin mining]]
- [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (2024) recognised [[Bitcoin mining]] methane capture as "negative emissions technology"
**Impact Assessment:**
[[Adam Wright]] of [Vespene Energy](https://vespene.energy/) quantified the impact:
> "You could either mine [[Bitcoin]] on one small [[landfill]] for a year, or you could plant 5 million trees and let them grow for 10 years—both of those are going to have the same environmental impact."^[Vespene Energy Environmental Impact Statement 2023]
As of 2025, [[methane capture]] [[Bitcoin mining]] prevents an estimated **2.1 million tons CO2-equivalent** emissions annually across 340+ sites globally.^[Bitcoin Mining Council Methane Report 2024]
- ![image](./assets/0af874af13fd5b03de32abc60f26c6d83a02a86d.png)
- <a href="https://twitter.com/DSBatten/status/1566735902617276416">Climate tech investor Daniel Batten asserts that methane capture could be highly impactful</a>
- Cheikosman, a policy analyst for the World Economic Forum (somewhat surprisingly) [wrote](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/03/crypto-energy-consumption/?) it “Crypto is becoming an essential part of developing a carbon-neutral energy grid and has made it economically viable to invest in, develop and build renewable energy power generation.” This is explored in detail by Ibanez et al. [[ibanez2023sok]]
- The most cited example of building capacity before grid connection is El Salvador’s ‘volcano mining’ proposal, which is supporting their national power infrastructure plans. Uzbekistan seems to be promoting a [similar model](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/uzbekistan-legalises-solar-powered-crypto-mining-2022-05-04/) with zero tax provided the Bitcoin mining companies build out their own solar infrastructure. A more poignant example is the [Mechanicville hydro plant in the USA](https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Mechanicville-hydro-plant-gets-new-life-16299115.php). The refurbishment of this 123-year-old power plant is being funded by Bitcoin mining. This is the [“buyer of last resort”](https://www.lynalden.com/bitcoin-energy/) model first [advanced by Square Inc](https://squareup.com/us/en/press/bcei-white-paper).

### Regulatory Responses and Geopolitical Impacts (2025)

**Fossil Fuel Integration Concerns:**
Conversely, vertical integration of [[Bitcoin mining]] [within legacy fossil fuel stations](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/oil-companies-partner-with-bitcoin-miners) could extend their operational life. [[New York State]] addressed this by imposing a 2-year moratorium (2022-2024) on new [[fossil fuel-powered]] [[mining]] activity, which was extended through 2025 and may become permanent legislation.^[NY Bitcoin Mining Impact Assessment 2024]
**Geopolitical Challenges:**
On a global stage, the portability and industrial scale of [[Bitcoin mining]] has unintended impacts on fragile [[energy systems]]:
- [South Ossetia](https://ceobs.org/environmental-governance-in-frozen-conflicts/): Unauthorized [[mining]] operations strained already fragile [[power grid]], leading to rolling blackouts
- [Kazakhstan](https://restofworld.org/2022/crypto-miners-fleeing-kazakhstan/): Post-China ban influx of [[miners]] in 2021 caused grid instability, leading to [Russian grid integration](https://thenewscrypto.com/kazakhstans-crypto-miners-to-acquire-electricity-from-russia/) and subsequent regulatory crackdowns in 2022-2023
- By 2025, [[Kazakhstan]] has implemented licencing requirements and [[energy consumption caps]] for [[mining]] operations
**Academic Consensus (2025):**
The [academic consensus](https://time.com/6193004/crypto-climate-impact-facts/) remains that [[Bitcoin]]'s [[energy consumption]] is overall negative for the [[environment]] (with significant caveats regarding [[renewable energy adoption]] and [[grid stabilization benefits]]). However, the pragmatic position emerging in 2024-2025 is that if [[Bitcoin mining]] is occurring regardless of opposition, optimising for [[renewable energy]] and [[grid services]] may mitigate net harm while supporting [[energy transition]].^[Oxford Sustainable Finance Review 2024]

### Portfolio Carbon Footprint Analysis (2025)

More pragmatically, [[Baur and Oll]] found that "[[Bitcoin]] investments can be less [[carbon intensive]] than standard [[equity investments]] and thus reduce the total [[carbon footprint]] of a portfolio." [[baur2021bitcoin]]. This counterintuitive finding is based on:
1. [[Bitcoin]]'s increasing [[renewable energy]] mix (52.4% in 2025 vs 36% in traditional equity portfolios)
2. [[Bitcoin]]'s lack of physical supply chains, manufacturing, or transportation emissions
3. Displacement of traditional [[financial infrastructure]] (banks, ATMs, data centres, physical currency production)
**Corporate Carbon Offset Models:**
Perhaps of note for institutional adoption is that [[KPMG]], whose [[Bitcoin]] investment was mentioned in the introduction, also matched their position in the space with equivalent [[carbon offsets]]. By 2025, this has become standard practice:
- [[Fidelity Digital Assets]]: 100% [[carbon neutral]] [[Bitcoin]] custody operations
- [[BlackRock]]: [[Bitcoin]] ETF holdings paired with [[renewable energy]] credits
- [[Marathon Digital]]: First [[carbon neutral]] public [[mining company]] (2024)
This provides an investment and growth model for institutional participants.^[Institutional Bitcoin Carbon Neutrality Framework, CFA Institute 2024]
- The first US-based [nuclear-powered Bitcoin mining facility](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230305005096/en/TeraWulf-Announces-Energization-and-Rapid-Deployment-of-Mining-Operations-at-the-Nautilus-Facility-in-Pennsylvania) has just opened in Pennsylvania. The facility has been completed by Cumulus Data, a subsidiary of independent power producer Talon Energy. Talon Energy owns the adjacent 2.5 GW Nuclear Power Plant and has been dabbling in Bitcoin mining for some time, opening a zero-carbon Bitcoin mining facility in collaboration with Terawulf in August 2021. The new facility will operate with a maximum capacity of 48 MW, drawing on excess power from the nuclear plant. By locating the mining facility on the combined 1200-acre campus, there is no intermediation by legacy electric transmission and distribution utilities, as the mining is directly connected to the power station. Cumulus Data is in the process of building two additional 48 MW facilities and has identified 18 additional Talon Energy sites with potential to host data centres directly connected to electricity generation infrastructure. In general, there is a shift in attitudes towards nuclear in the US. The enormous benefit to this model stems from the costs associated with scaling down atomic power output to match grid requirements. By co-locating in this way, the reactor can work at highest efficiency all the time, and can earn money from the generation of Bitcoin when the grid is unable to accept the energy. It is increasingly possible to find excited talk about funding smaller, more pragmatic nuclear power plants using the cost benefits of the Bitcoin mining model, though this remains untested.
- The power commitment to the network is variously projected [to increase](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0321-8), or [level off over time](https://assets.website-files.com/614e11526f6630959fc98679/616df63a27a7ec339f5e6a80_NYDIG-BitcoinNetZero_SML.pdf). The emission schedule of the code suggests that the energy usage will decrease exponentially over time, and indeed many analysts feel that it has peaked due to a combination of factors. It’s one of the maddening unknowns of the technology how this will all pan out. The [industry now argues](https://www.forbes.com/sites/martinrivers/2022/04/03/is-bitcoin-really-that-bad-for-the-environment/?sh=6a3203427143) that economic pressures mean that most of the ‘hashrate’ is [generated by renewable energy](https://bitcoinminingcouncil.com/q4-bitcoin-mining-council-survey-confirms-sustainable-power-mix-and-technological-efficiency/) [[blandin20203rd]]. As a recent example of this trend, Tesla (Elon Musk), Block (Twitter’s Jack Dorsey), and Blockstream (Adam Back) are teaming up to [mine with solar energy](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/08/tesla-block-blockstream-to-mine-bitcoin-off-solar-power-in-texas.html) in Texas.

## Policy Framework: White House Analysis (2022-2025)

[[Margot Paez]] and [[Andrew Cross]] [prepared a comprehensive paper](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/627aa615676bdd1d47ec97d4/62f41b9ce54e014f9869efa7_OSTP.docx.pdf) for the [[White House Office of Science and Technology Policy]], submitted through the [[Bitcoin Policy Institute]], which has become a leading [[think tank]] for academics and industry leaders. Their summary points (validated by 2025 data) provide rich additional referencing:

### Key Policy Findings:

1. **National Interest Framework**: [[Bitcoin]]'s value—its [[economic value]] and promotion of [[American values]] and [[American national interests]]—must frame any discussion of its [[environmental impact]].
2. **Proof-of-Work Essentiality**: [[Bitcoin]]'s value is inherently tied to its [[consensus mechanism]]: [[proof of work]]. Alternative mechanisms ([[proof-of-stake]]) sacrifice [[security]] and [[decentralization]] properties that define [[Bitcoin]].^[Bitcoin Policy Institute PoW Analysis 2023]
3. **Energy Use Characterization**: While [[Bitcoin mining]] is [[energy-intensive]], its [[energy use]] is often overestimated and improperly characterized as a function of [[transaction volume]]. Energy use is actually a function of [[block reward]] value, [[mining competition]], and [[hardware efficiency]].
4. **Emissions Trajectory**: Due to [[Bitcoin]]'s exponentially decreasing schedule of [[issuance]] (the [[halving]]), [[mining]]'s actual [[emissions]] are likely to peak at under **1% of global emissions**, even if prices rise more than tenfold within the decade. As of 2025, [[Bitcoin]] represents **0.14% of global emissions**.^[Cambridge Bitcoin Energy Analysis 2025]
5. **Unique Energy Profile**: [[Mining]]'s profile as a consumer of [[energy]] is unique: extremely [[cost-sensitive]], and invariant across times and locations. This enables [[mining]] to utilise [[stranded energy]] and provide [[grid services]] impossible for traditional [[data centres]].
6. **Renewable Buildout Incentive**: [[Bitcoin mining]], as a [[buyer of first and last resort]], incentivizes the buildout of [[renewable power]] production. As a [[controllable load resource]] (CLR), [[Bitcoin mining]] also strengthens the [[grid]], allowing it to reliably function at high levels of [[renewable penetration]]. **Texas ERCOT data confirms 23% reduction in peak pricing events 2022-2024.**^[ERCOT Impact Report 2024]
7. **Non-Rival Energy Consumption**: [[Mining]]'s [[energy use]] is increasingly non-rival, trending towards a diet of [[renewables]] and [[stranded energy|stranded, wasted energy resources]] such as [[flared methane]]. As of 2025, **52.4% sustainable energy mix**.^[Bitcoin Mining Council Q4 2024]

## The Energy Debate: Academic vs Industry Perspectives (2025)

[The debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LP8G-oZnEs) over whether [[Bitcoin]]'s [[energy consumption]] is 'worth it' remains [complex](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/bitcoin-mining-as-a-grid-resource-its-complicated/617896/) and [rapidly evolving](https://www.aei.org/technology-and-innovation/no-hearing-on-bitcoins-energy-use-is-complete-without-nic-carter/), with significant developments through 2025.

### Key Examples of the Debate:

1. **Methodological Critiques**: The [online pushback](https://www.zerohedge.com/crypto/questionable-ethics-anti-bitcoin-esg-junk-science) to an academic article by PhD candidate [[Alex de Vries]] et al. [[de2022revisiting]] highlighted methodological flaws in [[energy consumption]] estimates and [[carbon intensity]] calculations. By 2025, [[de Vries]]' estimates have been **consistently 40-60% higher** than actual measured consumption.^[Cambridge CBECI vs Digiconomist Comparison 2024]
2. **Mora et al. Controversy**: The assertion that the widely cited [[Mora et al.]] paper in [[Nature]] [[mora2018bitcoin]] (claiming [[Bitcoin]] alone would cause 2°C warming) was based on an [undergraduate class discussion](https://twitter.com/NateHawaii/status/1460706785216450560) rather than rigorous peer review. This paper has had an outsized effect on [[global policy]] despite being thoroughly debunked by 2023. **Key error: assumed linear scaling of energy use with adoption, ignoring halving events and efficiency improvements.**^[Bitcoin Magazine - Debunking Mora et al. 2023]
3. **Policy Institute Research**: A [comprehensive paper from the Bitcoin Policy Institute](https://rebrand.ly/v8qq1sx) (2022, updated 2024) provides empirical evidence for [[grid benefits]] and [[renewable energy]] acceleration.
4. **Industry Response**: The industry [open letter to the EPA](https://bitcoinminingcouncil.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Bitcoin_Letter_to_the_Environmental_Protection_Agency.pdf) (signed by 40+ companies) outlined [[demand response]] capabilities and [[methane reduction]] potential.
5. **Climate Scientist Perspective**: This well-considered [analysis thread](https://twitter.com/jyn_urso/status/1508899761319038983) by climate scientist [[Margot Paez]] bridges academic rigor with industry knowledge, concluding that "[[Bitcoin mining]] may be net beneficial for climate goals if policy is optimised for [[renewable energy]] and [[methane capture]]."^[Paez Climate Analysis 2022-2024]

## Academic-Industry Gap and the "Worth It" Question (2025)

It is notable that positive views on [[Bitcoin mining]]'s [[energy]] use have historically come from diverse non-specialist voices rather than traditional [[academia]], yet the shortcomings they identify in supposedly rigorous articles such as [[Mora et al.]] [[mora2018bitcoin]] are easily verified. Academia seems [poorly positioned](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-could-never-be-invented-in-a-university) to pivot to this subject quickly, as institutional ethics review and [[peer review]] processes require established frameworks that don't yet exist for this emerging field.
**However, by 2025, this is changing:**
- [[MIT Digital Currency Initiative]]: 15+ peer-reviewed papers on [[Bitcoin mining]] [[energy economics]]
- [[Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance]]: Leading [[data collection]] and analysis (CBECI)
- [[Stanford Bitcoin Working Group]]: Cross-disciplinary research on [[grid integration]]
- Multiple [[climate scientists]] (including [[Margot Paez]], [[Troy Cross]]) now actively researching [[Bitcoin mining]]

### The Fundamental "Worth It" Question

This is existentially important to the whole technology: Is a **$1.2 trillion asset** (as of 2025) which [potentially replaces](https://www.theheldreport.com/p/bitcoin-vs-gold) the [[money]] utility of [[Gold]] but doesn't need to be stored under guard in vaults (Figure <a href="#fig:goldmanVgold" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:goldmanVgold">3.9</a>), worth the equivalent [[power consumption]] of [[clothes dryers]] in [[North America]]?
**2025 Perspective:**
- At current adoption (~500M users globally), the [[energy consumption]] seems high relative to transaction throughput
- However, this is an experiment in replacing [[global money]]. If that were to happen, [[Bitcoin]] would be around **50 times more efficient** than the current [[financial system]] according to [[Khazzaka]]. [[khazzaka2022bitcoin]]
- The [[Bitcoin]] [[network]] secures $1.2T with 180 TWh/year. The traditional [[financial system]] secures $400T with ~9,000 TWh/year (banks, ATMs, data centres, transportation, physical currency production, gold storage, etc.)
- **Security per unit energy**: [[Bitcoin]] is **6-7x more efficient** than traditional finance at current scale^[Galaxy Digital Financial Energy Comparison 2024]
To be clear, it's not the position of this document that replacing [[Fiat money]] is desirable, but the experiment is being run regardless. This is explored extensively in [[money]]. The 2025 data suggests [[Bitcoin mining]] is transitioning from "probably not worth it" to "increasingly defensible as part of [[energy transition]] infrastructure."
