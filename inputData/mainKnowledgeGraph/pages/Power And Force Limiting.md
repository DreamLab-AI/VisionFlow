## Academic Context

- Brief contextual overview
  - Power and force limiting (PFL) is a core safety principle in collaborative robotics, enabling robots to operate safely in shared workspaces with humans by constraining the mechanical energy they can exert during contact
  - The approach relies on real-time monitoring and control of joint forces and torques, often derived from motor current or dedicated torque sensors, to ensure that any unintended contact remains below harmful thresholds

- Key developments and current state
  - PFL has evolved from a niche research concept to a widely adopted industrial safety feature, underpinning the design of most modern collaborative robots (cobots)
  - The integration of PFL into international safety standards has driven its adoption, with recent revisions clarifying validation methods and expanding scope to include end effectors and manual handling tasks

- Academic foundations
  - The biomechanical basis for PFL stems from studies on human injury thresholds, particularly for transient and quasi-static contact scenarios
  - Early work focused on dynamic modelling and sensor fusion to estimate external forces, with ongoing research exploring adaptive control and machine learning for improved safety estimation

## Current Landscape (2025)

- Industry adoption and implementations
  - PFL is now a standard feature in most collaborative robot platforms, including those from Universal Robots, ABB, KUKA, and Fanuc
  - In the UK, PFL-enabled cobots are increasingly deployed in manufacturing, logistics, and healthcare settings, with notable uptake in North England’s advanced manufacturing clusters

- Notable organisations and platforms
  - The Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC) in Sheffield has integrated PFL cobots into several research and demonstration cells
  - The National Composites Centre in Manchester has adopted PFL systems for composite material handling and assembly tasks
  - Leeds-based companies such as Siemens Digital Industries and Siemens Healthineers use PFL cobots for precision assembly and quality inspection

- Technical capabilities and limitations
  - PFL systems typically monitor joint torques and motor currents to estimate and limit applied forces, with real-time safety controllers enforcing compliance
  - Limitations include sensitivity to payload changes, potential for false positives, and the need for careful calibration and risk assessment
  - PFL is most effective for low-speed, low-payload applications; high-speed or high-force tasks may require additional safety measures

- Standards and frameworks
  - ISO 10218-2:2025 now fully integrates PFL requirements, replacing the previous ISO/TS 15066 specification
  - The standard defines explicit limits for force, pressure, and speed, with detailed guidance on validation and testing methods
  - UK manufacturers and integrators must comply with these requirements, often using safety-rated controllers and certified measurement devices
