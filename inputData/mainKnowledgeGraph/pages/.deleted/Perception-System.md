	- definition:: A Perception System is the sensor processing and environmental understanding component of autonomous systems that interprets raw sensor data to build a coherent representation of the surrounding environment, including object detection, classification, tracking, localisation, and scene understanding. Perception systems fuse data from multiple sensor modalities (camera, lidar, radar) to create robust environmental models for autonomous decision-making.

## Definition [Updated 2025]

A **Perception System** is the sensor processing and environmental understanding component of autonomous systems that interprets raw sensor data to build a coherent representation of the surrounding environment.

Core functions include [[object detection]], [[classification]], [[tracking]], [[localisation]], and [[scene understanding]].

Modern systems employ [[multi-modal sensor fusion]] combining camera, [[LiDAR]], [[radar]], and ultrasonic sensors.

Enables robust environmental models for [[autonomous decision-making]] in vehicles, [[robotics]], and [[intelligent systems]].
