## Hidden State

Hidden State refers to the vector representation of a token or sequence at any layer in a neural network, encoding contextualised information learned by the model.

- Industry adoption of hidden states is widespread in deep learning applications involving sequential data, such as language models, speech recognition, and financial forecasting.
  - Notable platforms utilising hidden states include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Hugging Face, which support RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs.
  - UK organisations, including research groups and AI startups in Manchester and Leeds, actively develop NLP tools leveraging hidden states for contextual understanding.
- Technically, hidden states are updated via weighted transformations and activation functions (e.g., tanh, ReLU) at each time step, integrating previous hidden state and current input to form a new state.
  - Limitations include challenges with very long sequences, which transformers have largely mitigated, though RNNs and their hidden states remain relevant for certain tasks.
- Standards and frameworks for hidden state handling are embedded within deep learning libraries, with ongoing efforts to improve interpretability and efficiency.
