- ## About Tokenomics Governance
  id:: tokenomics-governance-about
	- Tokenomics governance represents the sophisticated integration of economic design and governance mechanisms within blockchain protocols, where token holders exercise decision-making authority whilst simultaneously participating in the protocol's economic system. This dual nature creates complex incentive structures that align governance power with economic stake, value accrual, and long-term protocol sustainability. Unlike traditional corporate governance where voting rights are separate from economic returns, tokenomics governance intertwines these elements through carefully designed mechanisms that reward participation, encourage long-term thinking, and distribute protocol value to active stakeholders. The field encompasses diverse models ranging from simple token-weighted voting to complex vote-escrow systems, from inflationary reward structures to deflationary burn mechanisms, and from direct fee distribution to sophisticated game-theoretic incentive designs. As the [[DAO]] ecosystem has matured, tokenomics governance has evolved from basic models to highly sophisticated systems that address voter apathy, governance attacks, mercenary capital, and value extraction whilst promoting sustainable protocol growth. Leading protocols like [[Curve Finance]], [[MakerDAO]], [[Olympus DAO]], [[Aave]], and [[Compound]] have pioneered innovative tokenomics governance approaches that balance stakeholder interests, ensure long-term alignment, and create sustainable value accrual mechanisms. These systems demonstrate how economic design can shape governance outcomes, how time-locking can promote commitment, how fee distribution can incentivise participation, and how game theory can coordinate collective action. The integration of tokenomics and governance represents a fundamental innovation in organisational design, enabling protocols to align economic incentives with governance participation in ways impossible in traditional corporate structures.

	- ### Core Token Supply Models
		- **Fixed Supply Systems**: Protocols like [[Bitcoin]] and [[Uniswap]] employ fixed maximum token supplies (21 million BTC, 1 billion UNI), creating scarcity-based value propositions where governance power concentration increases over time as tokens accumulate in active participant wallets. Uniswap's UNI token distribution allocated 60% to community members (with 4-year vesting), 21.51% to team members (4-year vesting), 17.8% to investors (4-year vesting), and 0.69% to advisors, establishing long-term alignment through extended unlock schedules. This model prevents dilution but can create plutocratic governance as tokens concentrate amongst early holders and large stakeholders.
		- **Inflationary Reward Models**: [[Compound]] and [[Aave]] utilise continuous token emission to reward protocol participation and governance activity. Compound's COMP token was initially distributed at 2,880 COMP per day (approximately 0.44 COMP per Ethereum block), allocated proportionally to suppliers and borrowers on each market. This creates perpetual dilution for passive holders whilst rewarding active participants, theoretically incentivising ongoing engagement. Aave's Safety Module stakes 400 million AAVE (representing significant protocol value) to secure the protocol, offering staking rewards of 7% APY plus protocol fees, demonstrating how inflation can serve dual security and incentive functions.
		- **Deflationary Burn Mechanisms**: [[MakerDAO]] pioneered governance token burns through its MKR buyback-and-burn mechanism, where stability fees collected from [[Dai]] vaults purchase and permanently destroy MKR tokens. During 2020-2021, MakerDAO burned over 29,000 MKR (approximately $60 million at contemporary prices), reducing total supply from 1 million to under 977,000 MKR. [[Ethereum]]'s EIP-1559 demonstrated deflationary potential at protocol layer, burning over 3.5 million ETH (worth over $10 billion) in its first two years, creating continuous buy pressure and aligning token holder interests with network usage growth.
		- **Dynamic Supply Adjustment**: [[Olympus DAO]] introduced algorithmic supply expansion through bonding mechanisms where users exchange assets for discounted OHM tokens vested over 5 days. During its peak growth phase, OHM supply expanded from 1 million to over 14 million tokens, with the protocol accumulating over $700 million in treasury assets. This model prioritises protocol-owned liquidity and treasury growth over token price stability, representing radically different tokenomics philosophy focused on protocol control over external liquidity.
	-
	- ### Vote-Escrow (ve) Model Architecture
		- **Curve Finance's veCRV Innovation**: [[Curve Finance]] pioneered the vote-escrow model where users lock CRV tokens for periods up to 4 years, receiving veCRV (vote-escrowed CRV) that grants governance power and revenue share. The voting power decays linearly to zero as the lock period approaches expiration, incentivising long-term commitment. Users locking maximum 4 years receive 1 veCRV per 1 CRV locked, whilst shorter locks receive proportionally less. As of 2024, over 400 million CRV (approximately 45% of circulating supply) remains locked in veCRV, representing over $160 million in committed capital. This mechanism transformed governance from plutocratic token-weighted voting to time-weighted commitment, rewarding long-term believers over short-term mercenary capital.
		- **Governance Power Distribution**: veCRV holders direct CRV inflation to specific liquidity pools through gauge voting, controlling approximately 300 million CRV annual emissions worth hundreds of millions in voting power. This created the "[[Curve Wars]]" where protocols like [[Convex Finance]], [[Yearn Finance]], and [[Frax Finance]] accumulated veCRV to direct emissions toward their pools. Convex accumulated over 50% of all veCRV through its cvxCRV wrapper, effectively controlling Curve governance and demonstrating both the power and vulnerability of ve-tokenomics to meta-governance attacks.
		- **Fee Distribution Mechanics**: veCRV holders receive 50% of trading fees generated across Curve pools (the other 50% goes to liquidity providers), creating direct value accrual tied to protocol usage. During high-volume periods, this generated over $10 million monthly in distributed fees. The model aligns governance power with protocol revenue, ensuring decision-makers directly benefit from protocol success whilst bearing costs of poor decisions through their locked capital.
		- **Adoption and Variants**: The ve-model spread widely across DeFi: [[Balancer]] adopted veBAL, [[Frax Finance]] implemented veFXS, [[Platypus Finance]] launched vePTP, and dozens of protocols adopted variations. [[Velodrome Finance]] on [[Optimism]] modified the model with vote-reset mechanics and optimised emissions, processing over $500 million in weekly trading volume. The model's success demonstrates how time-locking can filter mercenary participants, reward conviction, and create sustainable governance structures.

	- ### Game-Theoretic Incentive Structures
		- **Olympus DAO (3,3) Game Theory**: Olympus DAO introduced game-theoretic language to describe optimal participant behaviour: staking (3,3) benefits all participants through protocol value accrual, bonding (1,1) grows protocol-owned liquidity, whilst selling (-3,-3) hurts all participants. The model incentivises cooperation over defection through high staking rewards (initially over 7,000% APY, later stabilising to hundreds of percent). At peak, over 90% of circulating OHM was staked (approximately 13 million of 14 million tokens), demonstrating remarkable coordination around perceived optimal strategy.
		- **Liquidity Mining Programmes**: [[Uniswap]], [[Compound]], and [[Aave]] pioneered liquidity mining where protocols distribute governance tokens to users providing liquidity or utilising protocol services. Compound's COMP distribution (2,880 daily) sparked "DeFi Summer" in 2020, with users earning 20-50% APY for borrowing and lending. However, this attracted mercenary capital that extracted tokens without long-term commitment, with studies showing 60-80% of liquidity mining participants exited within weeks of programme completion. Protocols learned to design longer-term incentives, vesting schedules, and loyalty rewards to combat mercenary behaviour.
		- **Bribing Markets**: [[Votium]] and [[Hidden Hand]] created markets where protocols bribe veCRV and vlCVX holders to direct emissions toward specific pools. Votium facilitated over $200 million in bribes during 2021-2022, with ROI calculations showing protocols could acquire $1-2 of emissions per $1 spent on bribes. This meta-governance layer demonstrates how economic incentives cascade through governance systems, creating markets for voting power that can either enhance or undermine protocol autonomy depending on design.
		- **Tokenomics Attacks and Defences**: Governance token economics created novel attack vectors: flash loan governance attacks (attempted against [[Compound]] and [[MakerDAO]]), vote buying markets, and accumulation attacks. Defences include time-locks requiring advance notice before voting, delegation systems that increase attacker costs, and ve-models that make accumulation prohibitively expensive. [[Curve Finance]]'s requirement to lock for up to 4 years makes hostile takeovers require enormous capital commitment, effectively defending against short-term attacks.

	- ### Fee Distribution Models
		- **Direct Fee Sharing**: [[SushiSwap]] distributes trading fees directly to xSUSHI stakers, creating straightforward value accrual. Users stake SUSHI to receive xSUSHI, automatically compounding their share of protocol fees. During peak periods, xSUSHI holders earned over $40 million annually in trading fees. This direct model creates clear incentive alignment but concentrates rewards amongst large holders and doesn't necessarily encourage active governance participation.
		- **Staking and Safety Modules**: [[Aave]]'s Safety Module requires users to stake AAVE or ABPT (Aave-Balancer Pool Token) to earn rewards whilst serving as first-loss capital in case of protocol shortfall. The module secured over $500 million in staked value at peak, offering 7% APY plus fee sharing. This dual-purpose staking creates stronger alignment than pure fee distribution, as participants assume protocol risk in exchange for rewards, aligning governance incentives with protocol security.
		- **Buy-Back Models**: [[MakerDAO]] uses stability fees to buy and burn MKR rather than distributing fees directly. This creates universal value accrual benefiting all token holders proportionally, avoiding concentration effects of direct distribution. Between 2020-2021, MakerDAO's burn mechanism destroyed over $60 million worth of MKR, demonstrating substantial value return. The model benefits passive holders equally with active participants, potentially reducing governance participation incentives.
		- **Hybrid Approaches**: [[Synthetix]] combines multiple mechanisms: SNX stakers receive trading fees from Synthetix Exchange, earn inflationary SNX rewards, and must actively manage their collateral ratio and claim weekly rewards. This creates multiple touch-points encouraging ongoing engagement. At peak, Synthetix distributed over $30 million annually through combined fee sharing and inflation, with 75% of SNX supply staked despite complex maintenance requirements.
	-
	- ### Liquidity and Governance Mining
		- **Liquidity Bootstrapping**: Protocols use token emissions to bootstrap liquidity in early stages, accepting dilution to achieve network effects. [[Curve Finance]] distributed 62% of CRV supply to liquidity providers over time, establishing deep liquidity (over $10 billion TVL at peak) that became self-sustaining. The strategy trades short-term dilution for long-term liquidity depth, betting that established liquidity attracts organic volume that eventually reduces emission dependency.
		- **Governance Mining**: [[Gitcoin]] pioneered governance mining through Gitcoin Grants, distributing GTC tokens to past platform users based on participation history. This retroactive distribution (15% of total supply to 625,000 users) created governance-aligned token holders rather than mercenary capital. Other protocols adopted similar approaches: [[Optimism]] distributed OP to users of applications on the platform, [[ENS]] distributed to .eth domain holders, and [[Uniswap]] airdropped to protocol users.
		- **Dual Mining Mechanisms**: [[Balancer]] combines liquidity mining (BAL emissions to liquidity providers) with governance mining (veBAL requiring 80/20 BAL/ETH LP token locks for voting), creating complementary incentive layers. Users progress from liquidity provision to governance participation, with each layer offering distinct rewards whilst feeding participation into subsequent layers.
		- **Emissions Optimisation**: Protocols continuously optimise emission schedules: [[Curve Finance]] implements weekly gauge votes allowing dynamic emissions adjustment, [[Frax Finance]] introduced AMO controllers that algorithmically manage emissions, and [[Balancer]] implemented veBAL boost mechanisms multiplying rewards up to 2.5x for governance participants. These dynamic systems replace fixed emission schedules with responsive mechanisms that adapt to market conditions.
	-
	- ### Value Accrual Mechanisms
		- **Revenue Capture**: Successful protocols establish clear revenue streams: [[Uniswap]] generates trading fees (over $2 billion cumulative), [[Aave]] collects borrowing interest and flash loan fees (over $300 million cumulative), [[MakerDAO]] earns stability fees (over $500 million cumulative). The challenge becomes directing revenue to token holders in tax-efficient, legally compliant manners whilst incentivising participation.
		- **Protocol-Owned Liquidity**: [[Olympus DAO]] pioneered accumulating protocol-owned liquidity through bonding mechanisms, building treasuries exceeding $700 million at peak. This permanent liquidity reduces dependency on mercenary capital, provides perpetual trading depth, and generates fee revenue for the protocol. [[Frax Finance]] adopted similar mechanisms, accumulating over $200 million in protocol-owned liquidity that generates ongoing yield.
		- **Productive Assets**: Modern protocols move beyond governance-only tokens to productive assets that generate yield, provide utility, or capture value. [[GMX]] distributes 30% of platform fees to GMX stakers and 70% to GLP liquidity providers, creating dual value accrual. [[Real Yield]] movement emphasises sustainable revenue distribution over unsustainable emissions, with protocols like [[GMX]], [[Gains Network]], and [[Camelot]] demonstrating profitability through fee distribution.
		- **Governance Power Premium**: Active governance participation creates value beyond financial returns through protocol influence and strategic positioning. [[Curve Wars]] demonstrated how governance control over emissions enables protocols to direct hundreds of millions in liquidity, creating meta-value in governance tokens that exceeds direct fee generation. This creates tiered value: base token value, fee accrual value, and governance power premium.
	-
	- ### Governance Power Versus Economic Rights
		- **Separation Models**: Some protocols separate governance rights from economic returns: [[Optimism]] introduced non-transferable voting power through Citizens' House (separate from OP token holders), [[ENS]] maintains separate .eth domain ownership from ENS token governance, and [[MakerDAO]] debates separation of governance MKR from economic participation rights.
		- **Plutocratic Risks**: Token-weighted voting concentrates power amongst large holders: top 10 addresses typically control 50-80% of governance power in major protocols. [[Uniswap]]'s top 10 delegates control over 60% of voting power, [[Compound]]'s top addresses hold similar concentration, raising concerns about true decentralisation and vulnerability to coordinated influence.
		- **Quadratic Voting Experiments**: [[Gitcoin]] employs quadratic funding where influence scales with square root of contribution rather than linearly, reducing whale dominance. Across 15 rounds, quadratic funding distributed over $50 million more equitably than linear models would have, demonstrating alternative governance weighting mechanisms.
		- **Reputation-Weighted Systems**: Emerging protocols explore reputation-based governance power: [[Maker]] debates Recognized Delegate Compensation, [[Optimism]] implemented Citizens' House with reputation-based selection, and various protocols experiment with participation-weighted voting where engaged members gain influence beyond token holdings.
	-
	- ### Challenges and Solutions
		- **Voter Apathy**: Despite sophisticated incentives, participation rates remain low: typical governance proposals receive 5-15% voting power participation, with many decisions made by small active minorities. Solutions include delegation systems (raising effective participation through representatives), vote incentives (rewards for participation), and reduced voting frequency (fewer, more impactful decisions).
		- **Mercenary Capital**: Liquidity mining attracted short-term participants who extract rewards without long-term commitment. The ve-model successfully filters mercenaries through time-locking requirements, whilst protocols increasingly adopt vesting, cliff periods, and loyalty rewards to discourage farming-and-dumping behaviour.
		- **Regulatory Uncertainty**: Token distributions potentially create securities law complications, particularly when combined with fee-sharing mechanisms. Protocols navigate this through geographic restrictions, decentralised distribution mechanisms, and careful legal structuring. The regulatory landscape remains evolving, with guidance varying significantly across jurisdictions.
		- **Complexity and Accessibility**: Sophisticated tokenomics creates barriers to participation: understanding veCRV requires grasping time-weighted voting, decay mechanics, and gauge voting; participating in Olympus requires understanding bonding, staking, and game theory. Protocols address this through improved documentation, simplified interfaces, and abstraction layers (like [[Convex Finance]] simplifying [[Curve Finance]] participation).
	-
	- ### Ecosystem and Integration
		- **Meta-Governance Protocols**: [[Convex Finance]], [[Yearn Finance]], and [[Stake DAO]] aggregate governance power, offering simplified participation whilst concentrating influence. Convex controls over 50% of veCRV through cvxCRV wrappers, effectively governing Curve through meta-governance layer. This creates efficiency gains (simpler participation) but centralisation risks (power concentration).
		- **Governance Aggregators**: [[Snapshot]] enables off-chain signalling for tokenomics decisions (over 100,000 proposals processed), [[Tally]] provides on-chain governance interfaces (tracking 20+ major protocols), and [[Boardroom]] aggregates cross-protocol governance participation. These tools reduce friction whilst increasing visibility into governance processes.
		- **Analytics Platforms**: [[Dune Analytics]] provides tokenomics dashboards tracking emissions, burns, distributions, and holder concentration. [[Token Terminal]] calculates protocol revenue and P/E ratios treating tokens as equity. [[DeepDAO]] tracks treasury values, governance participation, and tokenomics across 12,000+ DAOs. These platforms enable informed participation by making complex tokenomics legible.
		- **Cross-Protocol Standards**: Emerging standards include ERC-20 governance extensions (vote delegation, checkpointing), common interfaces for ve-tokens, and standardised treasury management practices. [[OpenZeppelin Governor]] provides battle-tested governance contract templates used by dozens of protocols, establishing baseline best practices.
	-
	- ### Future Developments
		- **Adaptive Tokenomics**: Protocols explore algorithmically adjusted emissions, dynamic fee structures, and automated supply responses to market conditions. [[Frax Finance]]'s Algorithmic Market Operations (AMOs) demonstrate protocol-controlled monetary policy, whilst [[Olympus Pro]] offers bonds-as-a-service to other protocols.
		- **Cross-Chain Governance**: Multi-chain protocols like [[Aave]], [[Compound]], and [[Uniswap]] deployed across multiple networks must coordinate governance across chains. Solutions include cross-chain bridges for governance messages, per-chain autonomous governance, and hierarchical models with main governance chain directing satellite deployments.
		- **Real-World Asset Integration**: As protocols incorporate [[Real-World Assets]] (RWAs), tokenomics must adapt to traditional financial regulations. [[MakerDAO]] manages over $500 million in RWA collateral requiring compliance-compatible tokenomics, whilst [[Centrifuge]] builds entire infrastructure for tokenised real-world assets with compliant governance structures.
		- **Improved Incentive Design**: Ongoing research into mechanism design, game theory, and behavioural economics continues refining tokenomics. Academic institutions like [[Berkeley]]'s RDI, [[Stanford]]'s Centre for Blockchain Research, and industry research teams publish studies improving understanding of governance incentives, voting behaviour, and optimal mechanism design.
