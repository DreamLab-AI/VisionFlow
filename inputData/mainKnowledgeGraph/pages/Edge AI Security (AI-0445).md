## Edge AI Security (AI-0445)

Edge AI Security (AI-0445) refers to edge ai security protects machine learning systems deployed on distributed edge devices against adversarial attacks, model theft, data poisoning, and unauthorized access while respecting resource constraints of embedded environments. edge security differs from cloud security by prioritizing offline operation, physical accessibility threats, and extreme resource scarcity. trusted execution environments (tees) like arm trustzone isolate sensitive ai operations in hardware-protected secure enclaves, preventing unauthorized model inspection or parameter access even by device operating systems. model encryption protects intellectual property; weights are decrypted only within tees during inference. secure bootstrap chains verify device firmware integrity before executing ai models, preventing compromised code from manipulating inference. defence mechanisms against adversarial attacks include input validation, anomaly detection, and certified robustness techniques tolerating small input perturbations. model extraction attacks steal intellectual property by querying inference endpoints; edge systems mitigate this through rate limiting, access control, and covert deployment of detection mechanisms. data poisoning attacks corrupt local training in federated learning systems; byzantine-robust aggregation protocols identify and exclude corrupted updates. physical attacks target edge devices accessing unprotected memory; countermeasures include side-channel resistance, differential power analysis defences, and information-flow isolation. privacy preservation through differential privacy adds calibrated noise to gradients and outputs, providing formal privacy guarantees. standards like nist ai risk management framework and arm trustzone documentation guide secure deployment. edge security requires balancing protection strength against computational/energy overhead; resource-constrained devices cannot employ computationally expensive cryptographic primitives. effective edge ai security integrates hardware-level protections (tees, secure boot), software hardening (model encryption, access control), and algorithmic defences (certified robustness) forming defence-in-depth architectures.

- Industry adoption of Edge AI Security has accelerated, with widespread implementation in sectors such as surveillance, industrial IoT, healthcare, and smart cities.
  - Notable platforms integrate AI-driven intrusion detection, real-time malware and phishing detection, and automated threat response directly on edge devices.
  - AI models continuously self-learn to detect zero-day exploits and advanced persistent threats, enhancing resilience against evolving cyberattacks.
- UK organisations, including innovative startups and established firms, are actively deploying Edge AI solutions, with a growing focus on compliance with GDPR and other data sovereignty regulations.
  - In North England, cities like Manchester and Leeds host AI innovation hubs fostering development of edge AI security applications, particularly in smart infrastructure and urban surveillance.
- Technical capabilities include:
  - Real-time anomaly detection and automated isolation of compromised devices.
  - Enforcement of encryption, authentication, and data protection policies locally.
  - Limitations remain in managing software updates, model retraining, and ensuring interoperability across heterogeneous edge devices.
- Standards and frameworks are evolving to address security, privacy, and operational challenges, with increasing emphasis on federated learning, edge monitoring, and compliance auditing.
