## Post Hoc Explanation

Post Hoc Explanation refers to interpretability techniques applied after a machine learning model has been trained, providing explanations for model behaviour and predictions without modifying the model's architecture or requiring retraining.

- Industry adoption of post hoc explanation techniques is widespread across sectors relying on complex ML models, including finance, healthcare, and climate science.
  - Common methods include LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations), SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), surrogate models, and saliency or attention maps.
  - These methods are model-agnostic, enabling application across diverse architectures without internal access.
- Notable organisations and platforms integrating post hoc explanations include major AI providers and open-source toolkits, facilitating transparency and trust in AI systems.
- In the UK, and particularly in North England, institutions such as the University of Manchester and the Alan Turing Institute collaborate with industry partners to advance explainable AI (XAI) research and deployment.
- Technical limitations persist:
  - Post hoc explanations provide correlations rather than causations, necessitating cautious interpretation.
  - They offer *statistical understanding* but not *component-level understanding* of model internals, which can limit their explanatory power in safety-critical applications (Molina et al., 2025)[3].
- Standards and frameworks for explainability are evolving, with increasing emphasis on empirical validation and ethical transparency.
