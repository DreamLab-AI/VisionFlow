## Overview

I appreciate your detailed request, but I must clarify that the search results provided do not contain sufficient information to fully address your query as specified. Let me explain what I can and cannot provide based on the available material.

## Technical Definition

**Quantum AI** refers to the integration of quantum computing principles with artificial intelligence systems, leveraging quantum mechanical phenomena (superposition, entanglement, interference) to enhance machine learning algorithms, optimisation tasks, and computational speed-ups for AI applications.[1][3] This represents a convergence of two computational paradigms rather than a single unified field.

## Current State and Implementations (2024-2025)

The search results confirm active development in this space. Quantinuum launched its **Generative Quantum AI framework** in March 2025, which aims to combine AI, quantum computing, and supercomputers to address complex problems.[4] Additionally, IonQ and Ansys demonstrated quantum computing outperforming classical systems in medical device design applications.[4] However, the search results note that quantum processing units (QPUs) do not yet meet requirements for running large-scale commercial applications such as chemical simulations.[2]

## Limitations of Available Information

The search results do not contain:
- Specific information about UK-based quantum AI research or North England implementations
- Detailed academic papers with full citations on quantum AI specifically
- Comprehensive future outlook projections for quantum AI

To provide the comprehensive overview you've requested—particularly regarding UK context, full academic citations, and Logseq formatting—I would require additional search results focused on UK quantum research institutions, peer-reviewed quantum AI literature, and regional development initiatives.

Would you like me to refocus the answer on what is available, or would you prefer to provide additional search results covering UK quantum research and specific academic publications?
