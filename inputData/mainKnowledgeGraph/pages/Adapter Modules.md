## Adapter Modules

Adapter Modules refers to small neural network modules inserted between transformer layers that are trained whilst keeping the original model frozen. adapter modules provide a parameter-efficient way to adapt pre-trained models to new tasks by learning task-specific transformations without modifying the base model.

- Adapter modules have become a standard technique for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) and transformers across NLP and other domains, widely adopted in both research and industry.
  - Notable implementations include integration into models like DistilBERT, LLaMA2, and Gemma, with advanced variants such as RaNA adapters achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy and efficiency.
  - Techniques like selective adapter freezing further optimise memory usage during fine-tuning.
- In the UK, several AI research groups and companies leverage adapter modules for domain-specific applications, including legal document analysis and biomedical NLP.
  - North England hubs such as Manchester and Leeds have active AI research communities exploring efficient model adaptation, often collaborating with industry partners to deploy adapter-based solutions.
- Technical capabilities include:
  - Significant parameter savings compared to full fine-tuning.
  - Flexibility to add or remove adapters for multi-task learning.
  - Limitations involve potential performance trade-offs on highly divergent tasks and the complexity of managing multiple adapters.
- Standards and frameworks supporting adapters are evolving, with open-source libraries (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers) providing modular adapter integration and community-driven benchmarks.
