Blockchain implementations combine QR scanning with backend verification systems, checking product histories against immutable ledgers to detect copied codes.
		  - **RFID Technology**: Radio-frequency identification enables automated scanning for inventory management and batch tracking, creating seamless physical-to-digital integration without manual intervention. Applications span warehouse automation, retail checkout verification, and anti-theft systems.

		- **Blockchain Architecture Components**:
		  - **Digital Twins**: Each physical product receives a unique digital identity during manufacturing, creating an unclonable link through serialisation recorded on immutable blockchain ledgers. The digital twin maintains an unalterable log of origin, supply chain journey, and authenticity verification checkpoints.
		  - **Smart Contracts**: Self-executing contracts automate verification logic, ownership transfers, and compliance checking. Implementations enable automated royalty distribution from resales, proof of shared ownership, and complex multi-party authentication workflows without manual intervention.
		  - **Cryptographic Hash Functions**: SHA-256 creates unique product fingerprints from NFC chip UIDs, whilst Keccak-256 secures pharmaceutical batch certificates in MediLedger implementations. These hashes provide tamper-evident verification—any modification produces completely different hash values, immediately revealing tampering attempts.

		- **Enterprise Blockchain Platforms**: **Hyperledger Fabric** dominates pharmaceutical and food safety implementations (Walmart, MediLedger, FarmaTrust) through permissioned networks with privacy controls. **Ethereum** supports public verification for luxury goods and NFT-based authentication (Nike CryptoKicks). **VeChain** provides enterprise-focused infrastructure with public verification elements for consumer-facing authentication.

Ethereum's ERC standards support NFT-based authentication (Nike CryptoKicks) and smart contract automation for public verification and ownership transfer.

	- ### Challenges and Limitations

		- **Physical-Digital Gap Vulnerability**: The link between physical products and digital records remains the weakest authentication point, as counterfeiters could potentially copy serial numbers or tags. QR codes face easy copying vulnerabilities, whilst even sophisticated NFC tags may succumb to advanced attacks. The "first-mile problem" recognises that blockchain trustworthiness depends entirely on initial data entry accuracy—fraudulent data entered during manufacturing persists immutably throughout the supply chain.

		- **Lack of Clear ROI**: Many enterprises cannot demonstrate clear return on investment, making measurement difficult and creating long payback periods that may require years to materialise. Strategic business considerations reveal that double marginalisation through indirect blockchain platform sales can reduce brand-name firm profits, whilst lack of coordinated pricing may damage profitability regardless of technology capabilities.

		- **Scalability and Interoperability**: Large-scale supply chain networks strain blockchain processing capacity, with some systems unsuitable for high-volume operations. Platform fragmentation creates established data-sharing protocol gaps, whilst legacy system integration requires substantial time and expertise. Different blockchains cannot easily communicate, and the supply chain management ecosystem lacks standardised interoperability frameworks.

		- **Implementation Reality**: No major pharmaceutical companies have fully implemented blockchain programmes as of 2024, with many projects remaining in pilot stages. Fashion and apparel industry adoption pace remains fairly slow despite extensive discussion. Scaling from proof-of-concept to full production proves difficult, requiring network effects where value increases only when critical mass of participants join—demanding competitor collaboration and industry-wide standards agreement.

	- ### Future Developments
