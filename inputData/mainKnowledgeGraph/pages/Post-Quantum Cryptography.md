## Academic Context

- Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) encompasses cryptographic algorithms and protocols designed to remain secure against adversaries equipped with both classical and quantum computers.
  - The academic foundation lies in the recognition that quantum computers, exploiting qubits and quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement, threaten to break widely used public-key cryptosystems like RSA and ECC.
  - Key developments include the formulation and analysis of quantum-resistant algorithms based on hard mathematical problems such as lattice problems, multivariate equations, and hash-based constructions.
  - The field builds on decades of cryptographic research, integrating quantum computing theory with classical cryptanalysis to anticipate future threats.

## Current Landscape (2025)

- Industry adoption of PQC is accelerating, driven by the imminent threat posed by quantum computing and the need to protect long-term data confidentiality.
  - The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) completed its first round of PQC standardisation in August 2024, endorsing algorithms such as Crystals-KYBER (key encapsulation) and Crystals-DILITHIUM (digital signatures), both lattice-based, alongside stateless hash-based signatures like SPHINCS+.
  - Hybrid cryptographic schemes combining classical and post-quantum algorithms are widely recommended to ensure a smooth transition and mitigate risks from premature adoption.
  - Technical limitations include increased computational overhead and larger key sizes compared to classical algorithms, which impact performance and implementation complexity.
- Notable organisations implementing PQC include major cloud providers and cybersecurity firms globally, with increasing integration into TLS protocols and VPNs.
- In the UK, government bodies and industry are actively preparing for PQC adoption, with a focus on standards compliance and infrastructure readiness.

  - Development of standardised hybrid cryptographic protocols combining classical and post-quantum algorithms.
  - Enhanced focus on implementation security to prevent side-channel and fault attacks on PQC schemes.
  - Integration of PQC into Internet of Things (IoT) devices and constrained environments.
- Anticipated challenges:
  - Balancing security with performance and usability, especially in legacy systems.
  - Managing the complexity of crypto-agility and ensuring rapid response to potential vulnerabilities.
- Research priorities:
  - Refinement of lattice-based and code-based algorithms.
  - Exploration of new mathematical foundations for PQC.
  - Development of comprehensive migration frameworks and tooling.
