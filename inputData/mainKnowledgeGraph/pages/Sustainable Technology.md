## Overview

- Sustainable Technology in Infrastructure & Cloud
  - **Technical Definition**
    - Sustainable Technology in the context of infrastructure and cloud computing refers to the design, deployment, and operation of IT systems and cloud services that minimise environmental impact through energy efficiency, use of renewable energy, waste reduction, and responsible lifecycle management of hardware and software[1][4][5].
    - It encompasses sustainable IT infrastructure practices such as energy-efficient data centres, virtualisation, and sustainable software development aimed at reducing carbon footprint and resource consumption while maintaining operational performance[1][2][4].
  - **Current State and Implementations (2024-2025)**
    - Cloud providers and enterprises increasingly adopt sustainable cloud computing practices, including:
      - Use of renewable energy sources (solar, wind, hydro) to power data centres, aiming for carbon-neutral or zero-carbon operations[1][3][5].
      - Advanced cooling technologies and energy-efficient server hardware to reduce power usage effectiveness (PUE), maintaining stable or reduced energy consumption despite growing data traffic[1][3].
      - Virtualisation and resource consolidation to optimise hardware utilisation and reduce physical infrastructure needs[2][5].
      - Sustainable software development focusing on optimising code to reduce CPU cycles and energy consumption[1][5].
      - Responsible e-waste management and circular economy principles applied to IT hardware lifecycle[4][5].
    - Cloud computing supports broader sustainability goals by enabling remote work, smart energy management, and environmental data analytics[1][4].
  - **UK Context and Examples, Especially North England**
    - The UK government and private sector are actively promoting sustainable IT infrastructure aligned with national net-zero targets.
    - In Northern England, several initiatives and data centres focus on sustainability:
      - Use of renewable energy-powered data centres in regions like Manchester and Leeds, leveraging local wind and solar resources.
      - Collaboration between universities and tech companies in Northern England on research into energy-efficient cloud infrastructure and green IT solutions.
      - Regional investments in sustainable technology infrastructure to support digital transformation with minimal environmental impact.
    - Examples include:
      - The Leeds Data Centre, which integrates renewable energy and advanced cooling.
      - Manchester’s tech hubs promoting sustainable cloud services and green IT startups.
    - UK policies encourage sustainable IT through incentives for green data centres and support for circular economy practices in e-waste management[2][4][5].

    - Recent white papers by HPE and IBM on sustainable IT practices and cloud computing energy efficiency[4][6].
  - **Future Outlook**
    - Continued innovation in energy-efficient hardware and AI-driven optimisation of cloud resource allocation will further reduce environmental impacts.
    - Expansion of renewable energy integration in data centres will approach or achieve 100% clean energy usage globally.
    - Growth of edge computing combined with sustainable cloud infrastructure to reduce latency and energy consumption.
    - Increased regulatory pressure and corporate ESG commitments will drive widespread adoption of sustainable IT infrastructure.
    - Development of circular economy models for IT hardware to minimise e-waste and resource extraction.
    - Enhanced use of cloud computing as a platform for sustainability analytics and smart infrastructure management across industries[1][4][7][5].
