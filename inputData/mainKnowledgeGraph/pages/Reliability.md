## Measuring Reliability

### Performance Metrics

   Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
   F1 = 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
   ```

3. **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**

   MSE = (1/n) Σ(y_predicted - y_actual)²
   ```

### Consistency Metrics

   ```

3. **Cronbach's Alpha**
   ```
   Internal consistency measure
   ```

### System Reliability Metrics

2. **Failure Rate (λ)**
   ```
   λ = Number of failures / Operating time
   ```
