## Enterprise Token Standards

Enterprise Token Standards refers to a component of the blockchain ecosystem.

- Industry adoption and implementations
  - Token standards are now a cornerstone of enterprise blockchain solutions, enabling the digitisation of assets, streamlined settlement, and programmable compliance
  - Notable organisations and platforms
    - Major financial institutions, asset managers, and fintechs use token standards to represent bonds, shares, and other financial instruments
    - Platforms such as Kaleido, Chainlink, and IBM Blockchain support a range of token standards for enterprise use
  - UK and North England examples where relevant
    - In Manchester, the Greater Manchester Combined Authority has explored tokenisation for local government bonds and community investment schemes
    - Leeds-based fintechs have piloted tokenised reward points and loyalty schemes for retail and hospitality sectors
    - Newcastle and Sheffield universities have collaborated on research into tokenised real estate and intellectual property
- Technical capabilities and limitations
  - Token standards enable features such as transferability, minting, burning, and programmable logic, but can be limited by blockchain scalability and regulatory uncertainty
  - Hybrid standards like ERC-1155 allow for both fungible and non-fungible tokens within a single contract, increasing flexibility
- Standards and frameworks
  - Ethereum Request for Comments (ERC) standards remain dominant, with ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155 widely supported
  - The InterWork Alliance’s Token Taxonomy Framework (TTF) provides a platform-neutral approach to token classification and interoperability
  - IEEE Std 3220.01-2025 offers a consensus framework for blockchain systems, supporting reliable and secure token operations

  - The Northern Blockchain Network supports knowledge exchange and best practice sharing among regional stakeholders
- Regional case studies
  - Manchester’s tokenised bond pilot demonstrated the potential for local government to raise capital through blockchain
  - Leeds’ retail loyalty token scheme showed how tokenisation can enhance customer engagement and data privacy
  - Newcastle and Sheffield’s academic-industry partnerships have advanced research into tokenised real estate and intellectual property

## Future Directions

- Emerging trends and developments
  - Increased adoption of hybrid token standards and multi-chain solutions
  - Greater focus on regulatory compliance and legal frameworks for tokenised assets
  - Integration of tokenisation with other emerging technologies, such as AI and IoT
- Anticipated challenges
  - Scalability and performance limitations of current blockchain platforms
  - Regulatory uncertainty and legal risks associated with tokenised assets
  - Interoperability between different token standards and blockchains
- Research priorities
  - Developing more efficient and secure token standards
  - Exploring the social and economic impacts of tokenisation
  - Investigating the potential for tokenisation in new sectors, such as healthcare and education
