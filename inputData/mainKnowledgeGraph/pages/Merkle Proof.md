## Merkle Proof

Merkle Proof refers to cryptographic inclusion proof within blockchain systems, providing essential functionality for distributed ledger technology operations and properties.

- Industry adoption and implementations
	- Merkle Proofs are integral to major blockchain platforms, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and various Layer 2 solutions
	- They are used in SPV wallets, blockchain explorers, and decentralised applications (dApps) to enable efficient transaction verification
	- In the UK, several fintech startups and blockchain research groups have adopted Merkle Proofs for secure and scalable transaction validation
- Notable organisations and platforms
	- Bitcoin SV Technical Standards Group (BSV TSC) has formalised Merkle Proof formats for interoperability and security
	- Ethereum Foundation and associated research labs continue to refine Merkle Proof protocols for Layer 2 scaling and privacy
- UK and North England examples where relevant
	- The University of Manchester’s Blockchain Research Group has explored Merkle Proofs in the context of secure data sharing and privacy-preserving protocols
	- Leeds-based fintech firms have implemented Merkle Proofs in lightweight wallet solutions for local blockchain applications
	- Newcastle’s Digital Catapult hub has supported projects using Merkle Proofs for secure and efficient data verification in distributed systems
- Technical capabilities and limitations
	- Merkle Proofs enable efficient, secure, and scalable verification of data inclusion
	- They are limited by the need for a trusted Merkle Root and the potential for depth attacks if not properly validated
	- The size of the proof grows logarithmically with the number of transactions, making it highly efficient for large datasets
- Standards and frameworks
	- The Bitcoin SV Technical Standards Group has published a standardised format for Merkle Proofs (TS 2020.010-31)
	- Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) and related standards continue to evolve, addressing new use cases and security considerations
