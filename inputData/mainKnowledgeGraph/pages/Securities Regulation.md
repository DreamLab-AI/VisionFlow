## Securities Regulation

Securities Regulation refers to a component of the blockchain ecosystem.

- Industry adoption and implementations
	- Securities regulation now extends to digital securities and certain cryptoassets, reflecting the convergence of traditional finance and blockchain-based systems
	- Notable organisations and platforms
		- The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) oversees securities regulation in the UK, including digital securities and cryptoassets
		- Platforms such as Tokeny (for security token issuance) and CME Group’s digital asset offerings are active in the UK market
	- UK and North England examples where relevant
		- Manchester-based fintech firms are increasingly involved in digital securities issuance, leveraging local expertise in financial technology and regulatory compliance
		- Leeds and Newcastle have seen growth in blockchain-based securities platforms, supported by regional innovation hubs and university partnerships
- Technical capabilities and limitations
	- Smart contracts enable automated compliance with securities regulations, but challenges remain in ensuring legal enforceability and regulatory alignment
	- Interoperability between blockchain platforms and traditional financial systems is improving, though fragmentation persists
- Standards and frameworks
	- The UK’s Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Regulated Activities) Order 2025 now includes cryptoassets as regulated activities, aligning with international standards such as MiCA in the EU
	- The FCA’s Market Abuse Regime for Cryptoassets (MARC) sets out rules for insider dealing, market manipulation, and disclosure
