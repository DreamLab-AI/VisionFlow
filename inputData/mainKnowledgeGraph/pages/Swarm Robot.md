## Swarm Robot

Swarm Robot refers to ### Primary Definition

- Brief contextual overview
	- Swarm robotics is an interdisciplinary field inspired by collective behaviours observed in nature, such as ant colonies, schools of fish, and cellular systems
	- The core principle is that simple, decentralised agents can achieve complex group-level tasks through local interactions, without centralised control or advanced sensors
	- This approach contrasts with traditional robotics, which often relies on sophisticated hardware, centralised algorithms, and extensive infrastructure
- Key developments and current state
	- Recent advances have focused on modular, reconfigurable systems that can adapt to dynamic environments and tasks
	- There is growing interest in biohybrid systems, where biological and artificial components interact to enhance swarm capabilities
	- The field continues to evolve with new materials, control strategies, and applications in both research and industry
- Academic foundations
	- Theoretical underpinnings draw from biology, mathematics, computer science, and engineering
	- Foundational concepts include self-organisation, emergent behaviour, and distributed intelligence
