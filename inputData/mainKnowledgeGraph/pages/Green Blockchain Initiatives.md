## Green Blockchain Initiatives

Green Blockchain Initiatives refers to a component of the blockchain ecosystem.

- Industry adoption and implementations
  - Notable organisations and platforms
    - Ethereum’s transition to PoS has set a benchmark for reducing blockchain energy consumption, with other platforms following suit
    - Projects such as Algorand, Cardano, and Tezos are recognised for their energy-efficient consensus mechanisms
    - UK and North England examples where relevant
      - The Energy Web Foundation, with UK-based partners, is advancing blockchain solutions for renewable energy trading and grid management
      - In Manchester, the Greater Manchester Combined Authority has explored blockchain for tracking carbon credits and supporting local green energy initiatives
      - Leeds-based startups are piloting blockchain for transparent supply chain management in sustainable agriculture
      - Newcastle and Sheffield universities are collaborating on blockchain-enabled smart grid projects, focusing on local energy sharing and carbon accounting
  - Technical capabilities and limitations
    - Modern green blockchains offer improved scalability and lower energy consumption, but challenges remain in ensuring security, regulatory compliance, and interoperability
    - Some platforms still face criticism for residual environmental impact, particularly in regions with less renewable energy infrastructure
  - Standards and frameworks
    - The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the British Standards Institution (BSI) are developing guidelines for sustainable blockchain deployment
    - The Green Blockchain Alliance, a global consortium, promotes best practices and certification for environmentally responsible blockchain projects
