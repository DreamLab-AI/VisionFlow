## Academic Context

- Computed Torque Control (CTC) is a classical nonlinear control strategy for robotic manipulators that uses feedback linearisation to cancel nonlinear dynamics and achieve precise trajectory tracking.
  - It relies on an accurate dynamic model of the robot to synthesise input torques that linearise the closed-loop system, enabling the use of linear control techniques such as PD or PID feedback.
  - The foundational theory dates back several decades and remains a cornerstone in robot control literature, with extensive academic treatment on stability and performance guarantees.
  - Limitations include sensitivity to modelling errors such as unmodelled friction, compliance, or parameter uncertainties, which can degrade tracking performance or cause instability under aggressive tuning.

## Current Landscape (2025)

- Industry adoption of computed torque control remains strong in precision robotics, particularly in manipulators used in manufacturing, automation, and medical robotics.
  - Modern implementations increasingly integrate adaptive and learning-based enhancements, such as grey-box computed torque controllers, which combine partial physical models with data-driven estimation (e.g., Gaussian Processes) to compensate for model inaccuracies and improve robustness.
  - Notable organisations advancing these hybrid approaches include research groups in Europe and North America, with growing interest in UK robotics labs.
- In the UK, especially in North England cities like Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield, robotics research centres and industrial partners are exploring adaptive computed torque methods for applications ranging from collaborative robots to autonomous systems.
- Technical capabilities now include:
  - Real-time parameter adaptation to maintain stability despite dynamic uncertainties.
  - Integration with impedance control to allow compliant interaction with environments.
  - Limitations persist in computational complexity for high-DOF systems and ensuring numerical stability during adaptive updates.
- Standards and frameworks for robotic control increasingly recommend modular controller architectures that can incorporate computed torque control as a baseline with adaptive layers.
