## Academic Context

- Edge mesh networks represent a decentralised interconnection of edge computing nodes that collaborate to provide dynamic load balancing, redundancy, and peer-to-peer communication for distributed workloads.
  - This concept builds on mesh network topology principles, where nodes communicate directly and non-hierarchically, enabling self-organising, resilient networks without reliance on central hubs.
  - The academic foundations lie in distributed systems, network topology, and edge computing paradigms, emphasising fault tolerance, scalability, and low-latency data processing at the network edge.

## Current Landscape (2025)

- Industry adoption of edge mesh networks has accelerated, particularly in IoT, smart cities, and industrial automation, where decentralised processing reduces latency and enhances reliability.
  - Notable platforms include 5G-enabled mesh networks utilising mmWave technology and protocols such as Zigbee, Thread, and Wi-Fi Mesh operating at different OSI layers to optimise routing efficiency.
  - UK organisations and technology hubs in North England—Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield—are increasingly deploying edge mesh networks for smart infrastructure and urban IoT projects, leveraging local innovation ecosystems.
- Technical capabilities include:
  - Self-healing network topologies that dynamically reroute data to maintain connectivity despite node failures.
  - Load balancing across edge nodes to optimise resource utilisation.
  - Peer-to-peer communication protocols that reduce dependency on centralised cloud services.
- Limitations remain in managing interference in dense deployments and ensuring security across distributed nodes.
- Standards and frameworks continue to evolve, with contributions from IEEE, IETF (e.g., IPv6-based mesh routing), and industry consortia focusing on interoperability and security.
