## Image Generation

Image Generation refers to image generation is the synthesis of realistic or stylised images using generative ai models including generative adversarial networks (gans), variational autoencoders (vaes), and diffusion models. modern image generation systems (dall-e, stable diffusion, midjourney) produce high-fidelity images from text descriptions, sketches, or latent representations, enabling creative applications, data augmentation, and content creation.

- Industry adoption is widespread across creative industries, entertainment, advertising, medical imaging, and data augmentation.
  - Leading platforms include DALL·E, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney, which generate high-fidelity images from text prompts, sketches, or latent vectors.
  - These systems enable novel workflows in content creation, reducing reliance on manual design and expanding creative possibilities.
- Technical capabilities:
  - High-fidelity synthesis with photorealistic and stylised outputs.
  - Conditional generation from multimodal inputs (text, sketches, semantic maps).
  - Limitations include biases inherited from training data, occasional artefacts, and challenges in fine-grained control.
- Standards and frameworks:
  - Ontologies formalise concepts and relationships in image generation, supporting interoperability and explainability.
  - OWL and RDF remain common languages for ontology representation, facilitating semantic reasoning and AI transparency.
