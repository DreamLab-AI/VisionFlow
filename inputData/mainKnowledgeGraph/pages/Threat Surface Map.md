## Academic Context

- Brief contextual overview
  - The concept of a threat surface map has evolved from traditional attack surface analysis, expanding beyond technical entry points to encompass the full spectrum of vulnerabilities, including human, physical, and social factors
  - Modern threat surface mapping integrates risk modelling, asset inventory, and exposure analytics to provide a holistic view of organisational risk

- Key developments and current state
  - The field now recognises that threat surfaces are dynamic, influenced by evolving tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) as well as changes in infrastructure and business processes
  - Academic research increasingly focuses on automation, continuous monitoring, and the integration of threat intelligence to enhance mapping accuracy

- Academic foundations
  - Rooted in systems theory and risk management, threat surface mapping draws on principles from cybersecurity, information assurance, and organisational resilience

## Current Landscape (2025)

- Industry adoption and implementations
  - Leading security teams treat threat surface mapping as an ongoing process rather than a one-time audit, integrating it into broader attack surface management (ASM) strategies
  - Organisations use a combination of vulnerability scanners, threat modelling tools, and network detection and response (NDR) platforms to maintain visibility

- Notable organisations and platforms
  - SentinelOne, ThreatMon, and Microsoft offer advanced threat surface mapping and management solutions
  - IBM and CyberProof provide threat intelligence and landscape reports that inform mapping practices

- UK and North England examples where relevant
  - Manchester-based cybersecurity firms have adopted threat surface mapping to protect critical infrastructure and support regional digital transformation initiatives
  - Leeds and Newcastle universities collaborate with local businesses to develop and implement threat surface mapping frameworks
  - Sheffield’s Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC) uses threat surface mapping to secure industrial control systems and supply chains

- Technical capabilities and limitations
  - Capabilities include real-time asset discovery, risk scoring, and continuous monitoring
  - Limitations include the challenge of maintaining accuracy in rapidly changing environments and the need for manual input to supplement automated tools

- Standards and frameworks
  - ISO/IEC 27001 and NIST Cybersecurity Framework provide guidance on threat surface mapping and management
  - The UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) offers best practices and resources for threat surface mapping

## UK Context

- British contributions and implementations
  - The UK has been at the forefront of developing and implementing threat surface mapping frameworks, particularly in the public sector and critical infrastructure
  - The NCSC and the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI) provide guidance and support for threat surface mapping

- North England innovation hubs (if relevant)
  - Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield are home to several innovation hubs and research centres that contribute to the development and application of threat surface mapping
  - These hubs often collaborate with local businesses and universities to address regional cybersecurity challenges

- Regional case studies
  - Manchester’s digital transformation initiatives have included the implementation of threat surface mapping to protect critical infrastructure and support economic growth
  - Leeds and Newcastle universities have conducted research on the effectiveness of threat surface mapping in various sectors, including healthcare and manufacturing

## Future Directions

- Emerging trends and developments
  - The integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning is expected to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of threat surface mapping
  - There is a growing emphasis on continuous monitoring and real-time threat intelligence

- Anticipated challenges
  - Maintaining accuracy in rapidly changing environments remains a significant challenge
  - The need for skilled personnel and the integration of manual input to supplement automated tools will continue to be important

- Research priorities
  - Research is focused on improving the automation and scalability of threat surface mapping tools
  - There is a need for more robust standards and frameworks to guide the implementation and evaluation of threat surface mapping practices
