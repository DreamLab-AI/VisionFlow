## Context and Significance

Stakeholder engagement represents a fundamental principle of responsible and trustworthy AI development and deployment. AI systems, unlike many traditional technologies, can affect broad populations beyond immediate users, create distributional impacts across society, and raise complex ethical questions requiring diverse perspectives. Effective stakeholder identification, engagement, and consideration ensures that AI systems account for varied interests, values, and concerns, reduces risks of unintended consequences, and builds social licence for beneficial AI applications.

The NIST AI Risk Management Framework emphasises stakeholder participation as essential to the GOVERN function, noting that trustworthy AI requires incorporating diverse perspectives throughout the AI lifecycle. ISO/IEC 42001 mandates organisations to identify and understand stakeholder needs and expectations as a foundational requirement of AI management systems. The EU AI Act reflects stakeholder concerns through requirements for impact assessments, transparency, and various protective measures addressing different stakeholder interests.

Stakeholder engagement must be inclusive, meaningful, and sustained—reaching beyond easily accessible parties to include marginalised groups, addressing power imbalances, providing genuine influence over decisions, and maintaining dialogue throughout the AI lifecycle rather than treating engagement as a one-time activity.
