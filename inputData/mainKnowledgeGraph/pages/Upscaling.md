- ## Overview and History

- **AI Upscaling** refers to the application of [[Machine Learning]] and [[Deep Learning]] techniques to increase the resolution of images and videos while preserving or enhancing perceptual quality beyond traditional interpolation methods

- The field evolved from classical [[Signal Processing]] methods (bicubic interpolation, Lanczos) to [[Neural Network]]-based approaches starting with SRCNN (2014), followed by [[GAN]]-based methods like SRGAN (2017) and ESRGAN (2018), and most recently [[Diffusion Model]]-based super-resolution (2023-2024)

- **Historical Milestones**:
  - 2014: SRCNN - First [[Convolutional Neural Network]] for super-resolution (Dong et al.)
  - 2016: VDSR and DRCN - Very deep networks with residual learning
  - 2017: EDSR wins NTIRE challenge with enhanced deep residual networks
  - 2017: SRGAN - First [[GAN]]-based perceptual super-resolution (Ledig et al.)
  - 2018: ESRGAN - Enhanced version with improved [[Generator]] architecture
  - 2020: Real-ESRGAN - Practical degradation model for real-world images
  - 2021: SwinIR - [[Transformer]]-based super-resolution architecture
  - 2023: StableSR - [[Stable Diffusion]]-based upscaling emerges
  - 2024: SUPIR and CCSR - Current SOTA using [[Latent Diffusion Model]]

- The transition from [[GAN]]-based to [[Diffusion Model]]-based upscaling [Updated 2025] represents a paradigm shift, with diffusion models providing better texture generation and fewer artefacts at the cost of computational complexity

- ## Mathematical Foundations

- ### Super-Resolution Problem Formulation

- The classical super-resolution inverse problem models low-resolution (LR) image generation as:
  - **Degradation Model**: `y = (x ⊗ k) ↓s + n`
    - `y` = low-resolution observed image
    - `x` = high-resolution ground truth
    - `k` = blur kernel (often Gaussian)
    - `⊗` = convolution operation
    - `↓s` = downsampling by factor `s` (e.g., 2x, 4x)
    - `n` = additive noise (typically Gaussian)

- The goal is to recover `x̂` (estimated high-resolution image) from `y` by learning inverse mapping `f: y → x̂` using [[Deep Learning]]

- ### Image Quality Metrics

- **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**:
  - `PSNR = 10 · log₁₀(MAX²/MSE)`
  - `MSE = (1/N) Σ(x - x̂)²`
  - Measured in dB; higher is better
  - Standard metric but correlates poorly with perceptual quality
  - Typical SOTA: 28-32 dB for 4x upscaling on benchmark datasets

- **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)**:
  - `SSIM(x,y) = [l(x,y)]^α · [c(x,y)]^β · [s(x,y)]^γ`
  - Compares luminance, contrast, and structure
  - Range [0,1]; higher is better
  - Better perceptual correlation than PSNR
  - SOTA models achieve 0.85-0.92 SSIM on DIV2K

- **LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity)**:
  - Uses pre-trained [[VGG]] or [[AlexNet]] features
  - `LPIPS = Σ ||φ_l(x) - φ_l(x̂)||²`
  - Lower is better (measures perceptual distance)
  - Best metric for [[GAN]] and diffusion-based methods
  - Modern models: 0.05-0.15 LPIPS scores

- ### Loss Functions

- **Pixel Loss (L1/L2)**:
  - L1: `L_pixel = |x - x̂|`
  - L2: `L_pixel = ||x - x̂||²`
  - Optimises for PSNR but produces smooth, blurry results
  - Used in early methods (SRCNN, VDSR, EDSR)

- **Perceptual Loss**:
  - `L_perceptual = Σ_l ||φ_l(x) - φ_l(x̂)||²`
  - Uses [[VGG19]] features from multiple layers
  - Preserves high-level semantic content
  - Critical for [[GAN]]-based methods (SRGAN, ESRGAN)

- **Adversarial Loss** (for [[GAN]]-based upscaling):
  - `L_adv = E[log D(x)] + E[log(1 - D(G(y)))]`
  - Discriminator `D` distinguishes real vs. generated HR images
  - Generator `G` produces HR images to fool discriminator
  - Enables photorealistic texture synthesis
  - RaGAN (Relativistic GAN) used in ESRGAN improves stability

- **Diffusion Loss** (for [[Stable Diffusion]] upscaling):
  - `L_diffusion = E_t[||ε - ε_θ(z_t, t, c)||²]`
  - Predicts noise `ε` at timestep `t`
  - Conditioned on LR image `c` and latent `z_t`
  - SUPIR uses this with [[SDXL]] backbone

- ## Classical Super-Resolution Methods

- ### Traditional Interpolation

- **Bicubic Interpolation**:

- ## Cross-Domain Applications

- ### Blockchain and NFT Integration

- **NFT High-Resolution Minting**:
  - Problem: Many early NFTs (2021-2022) minted at low resolution (512×512, 1024×1024)
  - Solution: AI upscaling to 4K (4096×4096) or 8K (8192×8192) for high-value collections
  - Use cases:
    - CryptoPunks: Upscale 24×24 pixel art to 4K for physical prints
    - Bored Ape Yacht Club: Enhance 1024×1024 to 4K for metaverse avatars

- **Blockchain-Based Image Provenance**:
  - Store original low-res image hash on [[Blockchain]] ([[Bitcoin]], [[Ethereum]])
  - Upscaled versions linked via [[Smart Contract]] to prove derivation
  - [[IPFS]] storage: Low-res (500KB) on-chain, high-res (50MB) IPFS with CID reference
  - Example workflow:
    ```
    1. Mint NFT with 1K image (IPFS: Qm...)
    2. Upscale with SUPIR to 4K
    3. Update NFT metadata to include 4K IPFS CID
    4. Smart contract verifies upscaling timestamp
    ```

- **Decentralized Rendering Networks**:
  - **Render Network (RNDR)**:
    - Distributed GPU rendering for upscaling tasks
    - Payment: [[RNDR]] token on [[Polygon]] (formerly [[Ethereum]])
    - Workflow: Upload LR image → Allocate RNDR tokens → Network processes → Download HR
    - Cost: ~$0.50-$2.00 per 4K upscale (vs. $0.10 local GPU electricity)
    - Benefits: No local GPU required, scalable for batch jobs
  - **Akash Network**:
    - Deploy [[ComfyUI]] or [[SUPIR]] on decentralized cloud
    - Pay with [[AKT]] token
    - Cost-effective: 3x cheaper than AWS/Azure for GPU workloads

  - Use case: Decentralized upscaling APIs
  - Example: User sends LN invoice → API upscales → Returns HR image
  - Benefits: No account creation, instant settlement, global access

- **On-Chain vs. Off-Chain Storage**:
  - On-chain (expensive): Only metadata + low-res thumbnail (32×32)
  - IPFS (permanent): Medium-res (1K-2K) for persistence
  - Arweave (permanent, paid once): High-res (4K-8K) for archival
  - Filecoin (decentralized): Cold storage for extreme resolutions (16K+)
  - Trade-offs:
    - [[Ethereum]]: ~$50-$200 to store 1MB on-chain (prohibitive)
    - [[IPFS]]: Free storage, no permanence guarantee
    - [[Arweave]]: $5-$10 per GB one-time payment

- **Smart Contracts for Upscaling Services**:
  - Automated payments upon delivery verification
  - Quality guarantees: PSNR/SSIM thresholds in contract
  - Escrow: Funds locked until buyer confirms quality
  - Dispute resolution: DAO voting on quality disputes
  - Example (Solidity):
    ```solidity
    function requestUpscale(bytes32 imageHash, uint8 factor)
        external payable {
        require(msg.value >= costPerUpscale);
        emit UpscaleRequest(msg.sender, imageHash, factor);
    }
    ```

- ## Technical Implementation

- ### Model Training Pipeline

- **Dataset Preparation**:
  - **Common datasets**:
    - DIV2K: 800 training, 100 validation (2K resolution)
    - Flickr2K: 2650 images (2K resolution)
    - RAISE: 8156 high-resolution RAW images
    - ImageNet: 1.2M images (general-purpose pre-training)
  - **Synthetic degradation**:
    - Blur kernels: Gaussian, motion, defocus
    - Downsampling: Bicubic, bilinear, nearest-neighbour
    - Noise: Gaussian, Poisson, JPEG compression
    - Real-ESRGAN: High-order degradation (blur→resize→noise→JPEG→resize→noise)

- **Training Configuration** (ESRGAN example):
  - Optimizer: Adam (β1=0.9, β2=0.999)
  - Learning rate: 1e-4 (PSNR pre-training), 1e-4 (GAN training)
  - Batch size: 16-32 (depends on GPU VRAM)
  - Iterations: 500K (PSNR) + 400K (GAN)
  - Hardware: 4-8× NVIDIA A100 (40GB), 5-7 days training
  - Loss weights:
    - Pixel loss: 1.0 (L1)
    - Perceptual loss: 1.0 (VGG features)
    - Adversarial loss: 0.1 (discriminator)

  - Example:
    ```python
    import tensorrt as trt
    # Convert ESRGAN ONNX to TensorRT
    builder = trt.Builder(logger)
    network = builder.create_network()
    parser = trt.OnnxParser(network, logger)
    # Build engine with FP16 precision
    config.set_flag(trt.BuilderFlag.FP16)
    engine = builder.build_engine(network, config)
    ```

- **ONNX Runtime**:

    def tile_process(image, tile_size=512, overlap=64):
        tiles = split_into_tiles(image, tile_size, overlap)
        upscaled_tiles = [model(tile) for tile in tiles]
        return blend_tiles(upscaled_tiles, overlap)
    ```
