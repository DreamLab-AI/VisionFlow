I appreciate the detailed request, but I must clarify an important limitation: you've asked me to review and improve an ontology entry, yet you haven't provided the **current definition** that requires updating. The query references "CURRENT DEFINITION: ### Primary Definition" followed by "FILENAME: BC-0118-market-capitalization.md," but the actual content of that file is absent.

To provide the comprehensive, technically rigorous revision you've requested—complete with current 2025 data, UK and North England context, proper Logseq formatting, and full academic citations—I would need to see the existing entry first.

## What I can offer based on the search results

The search results do provide current market capitalisation data for the UK[1][2][3][6], which shows:

- UK market capitalisation reached approximately **3,726 billion USD** as of November 2025[2]
- The GB100 index stood at 9,911 points on 11 November 2025, gaining 1.27% from the previous session[3]
- The ratio of total market cap to GDP was 104.98% as of June 2025, with a long-term average of 117.04%[6]

However, these figures alone don't constitute a complete ontology entry. Market capitalisation as a concept requires contextual framing around its definition, calculation methodology, applications, limitations, and theoretical foundations.

## Next steps

Please provide:

1. The existing BC-0118 ontology entry content
2. Any specific academic or technical framework you're using (e.g., is this for financial ontologies, semantic web applications, or institutional knowledge management?)
3. The intended audience and use case

Once you supply the current definition, I'll deliver a thoroughly revised entry in the exact format you've specified, incorporating current 2025 data, UK regional context, and appropriate academic rigour with a touch of wit where it naturally fits.
