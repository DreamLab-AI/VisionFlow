## Academic Context

- Backdoor attacks are a class of training-time adversarial manipulations targeting AI models, embedding hidden trigger patterns that cause models to behave normally on standard inputs but produce attacker-chosen outputs when the trigger is present.
  - These attacks exploit the AI training process itself, making detection difficult since compromised models pass conventional testing while harbouring covert vulnerabilities.
  - The academic foundation lies in adversarial machine learning and security, with seminal works exploring data poisoning, trigger design, and stealthy manipulation of model behaviour.

## Current Landscape (2025)

- Backdoor attacks have evolved from theoretical concerns to active threats in AI deployments across industries, especially where AI models influence critical decisions such as finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity.
  - Notable implementations of AI backdoor attacks include supply chain compromises where malicious instructions are embedded in configuration or rules files guiding AI code generation, as seen in attacks against AI-powered code editors like GitHub Copilot and Cursor.
  - Technical capabilities now include sophisticated evasion techniques such as zero-width characters and bidirectional text markers to conceal malicious payloads within seemingly benign inputs.
  - Limitations remain in reliably detecting backdoors due to their dormant nature and the complexity of AI model behaviour under diverse inputs.
- Industry adoption of defensive measures includes multi-layered AI security platforms integrating threat detection, behavioural analysis, and automated red team simulations to identify hidden vulnerabilities before deployment.
- Standards and frameworks for AI security are emerging, emphasising robust training data curation, model auditing, and continuous monitoring to mitigate backdoor risks.
