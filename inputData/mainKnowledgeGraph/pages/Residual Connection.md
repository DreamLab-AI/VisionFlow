## Residual Connection

Residual Connection refers to a neural network connection that adds the input of a layer to its output, enabling gradient flow in deep networks and facilitating training of very deep architectures.

- Residual connections are now a standard component in a wide range of deep learning architectures beyond computer vision, including transformers (e.g., BERT, GPT models), reinforcement learning systems (AlphaGo Zero, AlphaStar), and protein folding models (AlphaFold).
  - These connections facilitate training of very deep models by providing alternate gradient pathways, mitigating vanishing gradients.
- Industry adoption is widespread across AI research labs and commercial platforms, with implementations in frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX.
- In the UK, leading AI research centres in Manchester, Leeds, and Sheffield incorporate residual connections in their deep learning projects, particularly in computer vision and natural language processing.
- Technical limitations include increased computational overhead due to deeper architectures and challenges in optimising very deep residual networks without overfitting.
- Standards and frameworks have evolved to include residual blocks as modular components, with best practices for their integration and tuning documented in major deep learning libraries.
