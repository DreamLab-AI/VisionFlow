## Overview

# Digital Twin of the Customer: Spatial & Immersive Overview

## Technical Definition

A **digital twin of the customer** is a dynamic virtual replica that mirrors an individual customer's behaviours, preferences, interactions, and decision-making patterns within a spatially-aware digital environment, enabling real-time simulation and predictive analysis of customer journeys.[1][3] This construct integrates IoT data, AI-driven behavioural insights, and immersive 3D visualizations to create an interactive, responsive model that reflects how customers engage with products, services, and spatial environments.[2][6]

## Current State and Implementations (2024–2025)

**Retail and E-Commerce**

Digital twins are actively transforming customer experience through virtual fitting rooms and personalized shopping simulations.[1] Retailers now deploy customer digital twins to map entire purchase journeys—from browsing to checkout—identifying abandonment points and optimizing conversion pathways before live deployment.[3] These implementations leverage real-time 3D graphics and interactive visualizations across mobile, desktop, and immersive platforms (AR/MR/VR).[2]

**Hyper-Personalization and Predictive Support**

Brands utilise customer digital twins to create feedback loops powered by AI and IoT technologies, enabling anticipatory customer support and bespoke experience design.[1] Automotive sectors, for instance, employ predictive customer support models informed by digital customer twins, whilst smart city infrastructures use citizen behaviour patterns to fine-tune public services.[1]

**Cross-Functional Collaboration**

Digital twins now facilitate collaborative design, testing, and deployment across distributed teams, allowing organizations to simulate customer responses to strategic interventions before implementation at scale.[2]

## UK Context and North England Examples

The search results provided do not contain specific information regarding UK implementations or North England case studies of customer digital twins. However, the broader UK digital economy—particularly in Manchester, Leeds, and Newcastle technology hubs—has been increasingly adopting spatial computing and immersive technologies. Organizations in these regions would benefit from geospatial digital twin frameworks that integrate GIS-based mapping with customer behaviour analytics, particularly for retail, hospitality, and urban planning sectors.

## Key Research and Sources

The search results do not provide formal academic citations or peer-reviewed research papers. The primary sources identified are:

- **Unity Technologies** – "What are Digital Twins and How do They Work?" (Digital twin creation methodologies and real-time 3D visualization)
- **McKinsey & Company** – "What is digital-twin technology?" (Market analysis projecting 60% annual growth, reaching $73.5 billion by 2027)
- **Sprinklr** – "The Role of Digital Twin in The Customer Experience World" (Customer journey mapping and abandonment reduction)
- **PTC** – "What is Digital Twin and why is it important?" (Service uptime and spatial computing applications)
- **Esri** – "Digital Twin Technology & GIS" (Geospatial frameworks and time-aware representations)

For rigorous academic citations, consultation of peer-reviewed journals in human-computer interaction, customer experience management, and spatial computing would be necessary.

## Future Outlook

**Market Expansion**

The digital twin market is projected to grow approximately 60% annually through 2027, reaching $73.5 billion.[6] Customer-centric digital twins will likely become standard infrastructure for enterprise CX strategies.

**Technological Integration**

Emerging spatial computing and analytics will enable increasingly sophisticated digital twins of place, process, and people, offering both macro (bird's-eye) and granular (detailed) perspectives on customer behaviour within physical and digital environments.[5]

**Immersive Environments**

AR/MR/VR platforms will deepen customer engagement, allowing real-time interaction with dynamic, responsive digital twins across multiple devices and contexts.[2]

**Ethical and Privacy Considerations**

As customer digital twins become more granular and predictive, organisations will need to navigate data governance, consent frameworks, and transparency regarding algorithmic decision-making informed by these virtual replicas.

- # Risks and mitigations
	- Looking across the whole sector, this paragraph from the [[Bank of International Settlement]] ([[BIS]]) [sums everything up](https://www.bis.org/publ/arpdf/ar2022e3.htm):
		- "..it is now becoming clear that crypto and [[DeFi]] have deeper structural limitations that prevent them from achieving the levels of efficiency, stability or integrity required for an adequate monetary system. In particular, the crypto universe lacks a nominal anchor, which it tries to import, imperfectly, through [[Stablecoins]]. It is also prone to fragmentation, and its applications cannot scale without compromising security, as shown by their congestion and exorbitant fees. Activity in this parallel system is, instead, sustained by the influx of speculative coin holders. Finally, there are serious concerns about the role of unregulated intermediaries in the system. As they are deep-seated, these structural shortcomings are unlikely to be amenable to technical fixes alone. This is because they reflect the inherent limitations of a decentralised system built on permissionless blockchains."
	- This might seem like reason enough to stop here and wait for [[central bank digital currencies]] ([[CBDC]]), but [[Bitcoin]] is here now, is likely unstoppable in, and with mitigations in place might have uses if developed properly. Perhaps surprising the same [[BIS]] is [allowing up to 2%](https://www.bis.org/press/p221216.htm) of bank reserves to be held in crypto assets, including [[Bitcoin]], [according to their June 2022 [[Basel Committee on Banking Supervision]] report](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d533.pdf), though the [[BIS]] chief [[Agustin Carstens]] believe the ["battle" against crypto](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-22/crypto-has-lost-battle-against-fiat-currency-bis-chief-agustin-carstens-says) has already been won.
	- [[Lightning and Similar L2]] are still considered to be experimental and not completely battle tested. There have been various attacks and a major [[Double-Spending]] attack may be possible,[[https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2208.01908]] but there have been no major problems in the years it's been running with careful design choices and cybersecurity best practice it it likely a production ready component of [[Agents]] based systems.
- ## Sociopaths everywhere
	- In the wake of the [rampant crime spree](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-11-14/ftx-s-balance-sheet-was-bad) by [[Sam Bankman-Fried]] and his top teams at [[Alameda Research]] and the Bahamas registered exchange '[[FTX]]' the whole industry has suffered, and will continue to suffer, seismic shocks. There is a chance the sector will never recover, from the substantial negative sentiment in American democratic politics, and that we are seeing the top of the hype bubble in the crime adjacent [[Trump]] era. Fortunately this doesn't diminish our use cases for these technologies, as we were never planning to speculate with the asset, but rather use the network and protocol for complex systems.
	- **2025 Update**: The [[FTX]] bankruptcy proceedings resulted in recovery of ~$16B in assets with creditors receiving 100%+ of claim values at petition date prices (though not current [[Bitcoin]] prices). [[Sam Bankman-Fried]] sentenced to 25 years in federal prison. The [[Trump]] administration (2025) has reversed previous crypto-skeptical policies, with [[Executive Order]] repealing [[Biden]]'s [[Executive Order 14067]], establishing pro-crypto regulatory framework, and appointing crypto-friendly regulators to [[SEC]] and [[CFTC]].
- ## Crypto assets
	- For "crypto" assets more generally it is useful to look at the recent ["whole government executive order"](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/03/09/executive-order-on-ensuring-responsible-development-of-digital-assets/) ([[Executive Order 14067]]) signed by President [[Biden]] early in 2022. It was mainly framed in terms of "responsible innovation, and leadership" in the new space. The resulting, "Comprehensive Framework for Responsible Development of Digital Assets" was a product of multi agency collaboration and can be seen as 9 reports and a summary document, and was long anticipated. The summary itself is neither particularly comprehensive nor a framework, and mainly serves to identifies high level risks, aspirations, and challenges, and strongly hints toward eventual development of a "digital dollar" ([[CBDC]], expanded later). This work has been repealed completely as the [[Trump]] administration eschews [[CBDCs]] and openly promotes crypto.
	- https://twitter.com/kofinas/status/1881077334750421066
		- {{twitter https://twitter.com/kofinas/status/1881077334750421066}}
	- The risks section of the original [[Executive Order 14067]] shows how legislators are framing this, so it's useful to break down here.
		- Consumer and business protections. This is likely to pertain to custodians and is much needed. Misselling is rife. Security presents a challenge.
		- Systemic risk, and market integrity are a concern. The legislators clearly worry about contagion risks from the sector.
		- Illicit finance (criminality and sanction busting etc) are a concern, but not particularly front and centre[[moser2013inquiry]]. Criminality in 2021 was a mere 0.15% of transactions according to [[Chainalysis]], but this number varies year to year. There are claims that [[Iran]] have begun official overseas buying with cryptocurrencies, but again, the [numbers are small](https://finbold.com/iran-makes-the-first-ever-import-of-goods-using-cryptocurrency-worth-millions/). One of the better sections of the work is the [[US Treasury]] department's recently published 'National Risk Assessments for Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing, and Proliferation Financing'. This is a comprehensive report and speaks to careful research across the space. It is broken into [three parts](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0619). Perhaps surprisingly, while they do see activity in these areas, they do not rate the risk as very significant. Cash remains the main problem for illicit funding. There is some talk that the nature of public blockchain analysis allows greater oversight of these tools and that this is to the advantage of government and civil enforcement agencies.
		- Highlighting the need for international coordination suggests they are mindful of [[Jurisdictional Arbitrage]].
		- {{twitter https://twitter.com/iamLeonHill/status/1847973039234846747}}
		- The partial regulatory capture of these technologies, where activity flows to globally more lenient legislative regimes, continues to be a concern. Many of the centralised exchanges for instance are located in tax havens such as Malta. As the world catches up with these products it is likely that this will be smoothed out.
		- Climate goals, diversity, equality and inclusion are mentioned. It seems that the "environment" aspect of ESG is more important then "social" and "governance" at this time.
		- Privacy and human rights are mentioned.
		- Energy policy is highlighted, including grid management and reliability, energy efficiency incentives and standards, and sources of energy supply.
	- The [latest summary report](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/09/16/fact-sheet-white-house-releases-first-ever-comprehensive-framework-for-responsible-development-of-digital-assets/) resulting from the above guidance actually adds little tangible meat to the bones. This possibly reflects the complexity of these issues. The recommendations seem to be broadly as follows, and are really a copy/paste of the [[Executive Order 14067]].
		- Carry on doing research into [[central bank digital currencies]] ([[CBDC]]), but there's no particular rush.
		- Support development of better instant payment methods both at home and globally.
		- Ensure consumer and systemic protections.
		- More monitoring, civil and criminal prosecutions.
		- Issue more rules and clarity in response to risks (this is actually likely net positive as rules are currently unclear).
		- Improve global reporting on users ([[KYC]]/[[AML]]).
	- The government rhetoric to date in the USA can be seen to be converging on an understanding of the technology, at different rates in different parts of government. One thing that seems to shine through is their own perception of their global leadership on legislation on these matters. They seems to assume that what they decide will guide the world, and this may be true through their [[KYC]]/[[AML]] pressures.
	- A recent proposed [bi-partisan bill in the USA](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/heres-whats-in-senator-lummis-bitcoin-bill) will likely help inform global law, though it is unlikely to pass itself. It encourages the use of [[Bitcoin]] as a medium of exchange by applying a tax exemption on transactions of less than $200. The issue of whether an asset is a commodity (a raw material thing) or a security (a promise) is left to a couple of major government agencies to unpick, with corresponding reporting requirements. Crucially for this book these nascent bills all regard both [[Bitcoin]] and [[Ethereum]] as sufficiently decentralised to [qualify as commodities](https://www.coincenter.org/a-new-senate-bill-focuses-on-cryptocurrency-exchanges-heres-what-developers-and-users-should-keep-an-eye-on/), meaning they would enjoy more lenient oversight. Far more likely to pass is the [proposed [[DCCPA]] bill](https://www.agriculture.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/crypto_one-pager1.pdf) which has senior lawmaker support and would see commodities in the space regulated in such a way that trading of it could be halted in the USA. In this line of policy, exchanges will be required to do far more reporting, and would be penalised for trading against their customers. DAOs and [[DeFi]] are the big potential losers. In a maddening twist the Office of Government Ethics in the USA has banned anyone who owns digital assets from working on the legislation. This is an exceptional move and likely to result in poorly crafted laws in the first instance.
	- The most recent and troubling example is the US ban on any [[Ethereum]] assets which have been through a "mixer service" ([[Tornado Cash]]) [that obfuscates history](https://www.coincenter.org/u-s-treasury-sanction-of-privacy-tools-places-sweeping-restrictions-on-all-americans/). This is a huge constraint on the code and [[Smart Contract]] itself, not just [[Sanctions]] against individuals. It has ['free speech'](https://hoffmang9.github.io/free-speech/the-history-code-is-free-speech.html) and constitutional implications.[[anderson2002free]] More such actions and [arrests of developers](https://www.dw.com/en/dutch-investigators-say-developer-of-tornado-cash-arrested/a-62793823) are feared. It has led to [[Circle]] (who issue the [[USDC]] [[Stablecoin]]) blacklisting every [address sanctioned by the US government](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/recent-actions/20220808). Centrally issued digital assets are obviously neither uncensorable nor permissionless. This intersects (again) with the whole question of what decentralisation means and how effective it can be in it's stated goal of circumventing global policies.
- # Bitcoin technical risks
	- In addition it's useful for this document to focus more on the technical challenges to the [[Bitcoin]] network.
		- The [[Block Reward]] is reduced every 4 years ([[Halving]] epochs). This means a portion of the [[Mining]] reward is trending to zero, and nobody knows what effect this will have on the incentives for [securing the network](https://www.truthcoin.info/blog/security-budget-ii-mm/) through [[Proof of Work]].[[carlsten2016instability]] It is increasingly [being discussed](https://cryptostackers.substack.com/p/bitcoin-is-not-a-store-of-value?sd=pf&s=r) as the major eventual problem for the network.
		- **2025 Update**: The April 2024 [[Halving]] (fourth epoch) reduced [[Block Reward]] from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC. Transaction fees now represent 8-15% of miner revenue (up from 2-5% historically), but long-term security budget concerns persist as block subsidy continues declining toward zero.
		- [[Stablecoins]] are a vital transitional technology (described later) but do not meaningfully exist yet on the [[Bitcoin]] network. This may change.
		- [[Bitcoin]] lacks privacy by design. All transactions are publicly viewable. This is a major drag to the concept of BTC as a money. Upgrade of the network is possible, and has indeed been achieved for a [[Bitcoin]] fork called [[Litecoin]].[[fuchsbauer2019aggregate]]
		- The [[Lightning Network]] (described later) has terrible UX design at this time.
		- The basic 'usability' of the network is still poor in the main. Any problems which users experience demand a steep learning curve and risk loss of funds. There is obviously no technical support number people can call.
		- Only around one billion unspent transactions can be generated a year on the network. This means that it might become impossible for everyone on the planet to have their own [[Bitcoin]] address (with it's associated underpinning [[UTXO]]).
		- Chip manufacture is concentrated in only a few companies and countries, as identified by [Matthew Pines](https://www.btcpolicy.org/authors/matthew-pines).
		- Potential constraints on [[Monetary Policy]] flexibility.
		- Future protocol changes.
		- Unanticipated effects on the domestic and international energy system.
		- Vulnerability to adversary attacks are [widely studied](https://braiins.com/blog/bitcoin-mining-attacks-explained)[[apostolaki2016hijacking; @apostolaki2017hijacking; @johnson2014game; @stinner2022proof]], and still pretty much completely speculative because of the complex nature of the attack surface.
		- [[Mining]] tends toward economy of scale concentration. Many are already on their [own specialised network](https://bitcoinfibre.org/) ([[FIBRE]]) to connect to one another.
		- Future [[Hard Fork]]s. There will doubtless be pressure to fork the code to add inflation, or ESG mitigations, or to fix the UNIX clock issue in 2106. Each fork is a risk.
		- Other unknown, unanticipated risks given [[Bitcoin]]'s limited 13-year history.
		- There is a "non-zero" chance that [[Bitcoin]] is a complex government intelligence agency construct, [much like Crypto AG was](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto_AG) toward the end of the last century.[[dymydiuk2020rubicon]]
- # Risks (money, not technical)
	- Special thanks to economist Tim Millar for help with this section.
	- ## Risks to Bitcoin the money (intrinsic)
		- ### Geopolitics
			- It can be seen that following the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, that [[Sanctions]] of various kinds were applied to the Russian economy. One of these was the previously discussed [[SWIFT]] international settlement network. Another whole category was the removal of support by private businesses domiciled outside of Russia and Ukraine, and pertinent here is that [[VISA]], [[Mastercard]], [[PayPal]], and [[Western Union]] all removed support for their product rails. This means that while some cards and services still work, and will likely work again through Chinese proxies in the coming months, considerable disruption will be felt by Russian companies and individuals. This is not to say that this disruption is necessarily wrong, but it is clear now that all of these global financial transfer products and services are contingent on political factors. The same might be true of [[CBDC]] products if they gain traction globally. There is certainly no reason why all money within a physically delineated border could not be blocked or cancelled. This is not as true for [[Bitcoin]] at this time.
			- However, with enough political will it is technically plausible to incentivise miners with additional payments to exclude transactions from geolocated wallets. This would be mitigated by [[Tor]], and in a global anonymous network it is very likely that a miner could be found at a higher price for inclusion in the next block.
			- We have already seen much negative political positioning related to the energy concerns in an earlier chapter. There are similar noises coming from policy makers with regard to the money utility of the technology. The [[United Nations]] ([[UNCTAD]]) [have made the following recommendations](https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/presspb2022d8_en.pdf):
				- "Developing countries may have less room to manoeuvre, yet the regulation of cryptocurrencies is possible. The following policies, among others, have the potential to curb the further spread of the risks of cryptocurrencies and [[Stablecoins]]:
					- Ensuring comprehensive financial regulation, through the following actions:
					- Require the mandatory registration of crypto-exchanges and digital wallets and make the use of cryptocurrencies less attractive, for example by charging entry fees for crypto-exchanges and digital wallets and/or imposing financial transaction taxes on cryptocurrency trading;
					- Ban regulated financial institutions from holding [[Stablecoins]] and cryptocurrencies or offering related products to clients;
					- Regulate [[Decentralized Finance]] ([[DeFi]]) (such finance may, in fact, not be fully decentralized, given its central management and ownership, which form an entry point for regulation);
					- Restricting or prohibiting the advertisement of crypto-exchanges and digital wallets in public spaces and on social media. This new type of virtual, and often disguised, advertisement requires policymakers to expand the scope of regulation beyond traditional media. This is an urgent need in terms of consumer protection in countries with low levels of financial literacy, as even limited exposure to cryptocurrencies may lead to significant losses;
					- Creating a public payment system to serve as a public good, such as a [[central bank digital currency]] ([[CBDC]]). In the light of the regulatory and technological complexity of [[central bank digital currencies]] and the urgent need to provide safe, reliable and affordable payment systems, authorities could also examine other possibilities, including fast retail payment systems.
			- This is tough talk. We have seen that the [[IMF]] is willing to make their loans contingent on such regulation, and are increasingly [talking about banning](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2023/02/23/pr2351-imf-executive-board-discusses-elements-of-effective-policies-for-crypto-assets) the technology. This global response to the technology is a significant headwind, but like the internet itself, it's very hard to actually stop these products being used.
		- ### Capture by traditional finance [[Update Cycle]]
			- As the popularity of [[Bitcoin]] continues to grow, traditional financial market incumbents have begun to take notice. In an effort to assert their dominance and protect their interests, these incumbents have turned to regulation and acquisition as means of capturing the growing markets. This is most clear in the 'alt coin' space where traditional banks have leveraged their knowledge and marketing to transfer money from retail investors into their own venture capital operations. This is not to say that [[Bitcoin]] is immune from these harms.
			- One way that traditional financial market incumbents have sought to capture the [[Bitcoin]] market is through the use of regulatory frame works. By working with government agencies (as described in previous chapters), to develop and implement regulations governing the use and trade of cryptocurrencies, these incumbents are able to limit competition and control the flow of capital into and out of the markets. They are also able to "print [[Paper Bitcoin]]", running a [[Fractional Reserve]] operation, as happened in the [[FTX]]/[[Alameda Research]] fiasco.
			- We have already described how, in the United States, the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] ([[SEC]]) has implemented regulations governing the issuance and trading of [[Bitcoin]]-based securities. These regulations, which require issuers of [[Bitcoin]]-based securities to register with the [[SEC]] and comply with a variety of reporting and disclosure requirements, have effectively made it difficult for small and independent players to enter the market.
			- Another way that traditional financial market incumbents have sought to capture the [[Bitcoin]] market is through the use of partnerships and acquisitions. As the newer companies stumble and fail as a result of poor risk management and over-leverage it seems that Wall Street incumbents like [[Goldman Sachs]] are [taking advantage of the opportunity](https://www.reuters.com/technology/goldman-sachs-hunt-bargain-crypto-firms-after-ftx-fiasco-2022-12-06/) at structural scale. By acquiring existing crypto companies, these incumbents are able to gain access to the technology, expertise, and customer base of these companies, giving them a significant advantage over their competitors.
			- For example, in 2017, the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] ([[CME]]) partnered with the [[CBOE]] to launch [[Bitcoin]] futures trading. This partnership allowed the [[CME]] and [[CBOE]] to tap into the growing market for [[Bitcoin]] derivatives, while also providing a means for traditional financial market participants to gain exposure to [[Bitcoin]] without having to hold the underlying asset. This is a crucial risk to the emerging technology as ownership of the underlying asset ([[Self-Custody]]) was supposed to be the whole point of the technology. Ben Hunt of epsilon theory said:
				- "..if you don't see that the crypto quote-unquote industry has become just as blindingly corrupt as the traditional Financial Services industry it was supposed to replace well you're just not paying attention what made [[Bitcoin]] special is nearly lost and what remains is a false and constructed narrative that exists in service to Wall Street in Washington rather than in resistance; the [[Bitcoin]] narrative must be renewed and that will change everything"
			- The current line of attack by the US government sees stringent tax reporting law proposed for 2025, which will if enacted ban [[Self-Custody]] of the asset. It remains to be seen whether the public will tolerate this push toward centralised [[Bitcoin ETF]] as the defacto asset.
			- **2025 Update**: The January 2024 approval of spot [[Bitcoin ETF]]s by the [[SEC]] (led by [[BlackRock]]'s iShares Bitcoin Trust) marked a watershed moment for institutional adoption. These ETFs accumulated over $60B in assets within 12 months, with [[BlackRock]], [[Fidelity]], and [[Grayscale]] as dominant players. However, this has accelerated concerns about [[Paper Bitcoin]] and [[Fractional Reserve]] risks, as most ETF holders never take [[Self-Custody]]. The [[Trump]] administration's 2025 policy shift removed proposed [[Self-Custody]] restrictions, reversing the trend toward forced custodial arrangements.
		- ### Liquidity Lottery
			- Because holders of BTC are disincentived to sell the asset (assuming future gains) it is likely vulnerable to something [Kao called the 'liquidity lottery'](https://twitter.com/UrbanKaoboy/status/1526311908709502977). This is a supply/demand mismatch which he thinks could spell the end of the asset class in time. Macro analyst group ['Doomberg'](https://doomberg.substack.com/) believe that this mispricing of the asset is the significant risk, and point out that if [[Bitcoin]] is approached within the framework of government controlled Fiat, then there is no ['there there'](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/there_is_no_there_there). [[Bitcoin]] does not generate more fiat money within it's ecosystem (as say an energy extraction company would), and as such is very suggestive of the features of a Ponzi. They have recently softened on this view, and are now clear to separate [[Bitcoin]] from the wider 'crypto' world, which they remain convinced are simply scams, wash trading magic beans without any productivity. The value is dependent on finding the 'greater fool' mentioned near the start of the book. [Doomberg assert](https://doomberg.substack.com/p/dollars-ex-machina) that the price of the asset has been inflated by manipulation in the unregulated [[Stablecoin]] markets (specifically [[Tether]]), and in the event of a 'run for the exits' there would be a serious repricing. This seems entirely possible, and perhaps even likely, below an unknown threshold of confidence. They are now asserting that if the manipulation and mispricing could be 'washed out' of [[Bitcoin]] then it would present an investment opportunity, and they estimate that price at around $3000. We think that the combination of global speed of exchange of value, generative AI, and bots which leverage the network to create value within the ecosystem of the network, that this thesis does not stand true, but there is no way to know for sure at this time.
		- ### Manipulation of price or the network
			- [[Bitcoin]] is still young and illiquid enough to be highly manipulable. Imagine for instance if a major organisation or nation state wished to accumulate a significant amount of the asset, but would prefer a lower price.
			- There is an unknown level of exposure to risk from centralised [[Mining]]. If a few of the major [[Mining]] pools were simultaneously infiltrated by a nation state actor then it might be possible to engineer a 'deep [[Re-org Attack]]' of a large transaction. This would be dealt with quickly and almost certainly be a transient attack, but the damage to the narrative might be substantial. The proposed solution to this known vulnerability is called ['[[Stratum V2]]'](https://braiins.com/stratum-v2) in which the transaction in the blocks would be organised by pool miners or their delegates, with an increase in efficiency as a driving incentive. A similar vulnerability exists in the centralisation at the level of internet service providers.[[apostolaki2017hijacking]] This or some other flaw might lead to a selling cascade. Nobody knows just how vulnerable to selling cascades [[Bitcoin]] might be against a really serious challenge by an empowered actor, but it's already high volatility is suggestive of risk.
		- ### Rehypothecation
			- It's vulnerable to [[Rehypothecation]] ([[Paper Bitcoin]] managed by centralised entities running a [[Fractional Reserve]]).
			- It seems that this image by [[Nassim Taleb]] is a cautionary tale. [[taleb2012antifragile]]

			   [[Nassim Taleb]]'s Turkey Problem
		- ### Scaling
			- Scalability is always going to be a problem for [[Bitcoin]], for all the reasons discussed in the blockchain chapter. There is no "ready to go" solution (except perhaps federations) that could onboard the whole world at this time because of the limited number of available [[UTXOs]].
			- Finally, a lack of fungibility, and privacy by default in [[Bitcoin]], trends towards blacklists and over time this could seriously compromise the use of the asset.
		- ### Centralisation of the money over time
			- In a medium term future it's possible to imagine a smart enough autonomous AI or ML actor managing to accrue [[Bitcoin]] through fast and smart 'decisions'. This could unreasonably centralise the asset, and it would be impossible to claw this situation back. These constructs would last for the lifetime of the chain unless constrained by timelock multisigs for instance.
- ## Bitcoin externalities (extrinsic)
	- This section is the risks that [[Bitcoin]] poses to external money systems, but it's worth pointing out that a risk to wider society is clearly also a risk to [[Bitcoin]] itself.
	- ##### Inherent volatility
		- One of the better public analysts of the asset, sees the price eventually fluctuating somewhere between 700k  and 300k.

		- This is not how a money is supposed to work.
		- [Cycle theory revisited blogpost](https://davethewave.substack.com/p/cycle-theory-revisited?s=r)
		- Neither though is it the endless ["number go up"](https://stephanlivera.com/episode/147/) that speculators have been promised. The aims of the project have a cognitive dissonance right at the core. The volatility trends toward:
	- ##### Unfair distribution
		- By design the distribution of [[Bitcoin]] is likely 'fair', in that everyone has been able to access and secure the asset long term without prejudice. This image from Twitter user @Geertjancap shows the distribution in 2021. Whether this is judged to be fair if the asset jumps to 10 times it's current value, minting a new class of hyper rich holders, is another matter.
		- ![](./assets/3c46c793cd3e9cdedc88623cafee35ef0ac7ebf0.jpg)

		- {{twitter https://twitter.com/Geertjancap/status/1380972132990136322/photo/1}}
		- [[Bitcoin]] distribution is skewed to a few early holders, but it likely is fair.
	- ### The Bitcoin Culture
	- This pressure to emulate the early winners leads to:
		- ##### Endless HODL
			- It's possible that there's a problem with people not wanting to sell the asset, because they are predisposed to a particular fervour promoted within the community. This can be seen in the [glassnode data](https://en.macromicro.me/charts/32355/bitcoin-supply-last-active-1plus-years-ago), where the black line in Figure<a href="#fig:notselling" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:notselling">4.9</a> shows that the asset held for more than a year (illiquid) has increased over the years.
			- ![](./assets/71c52745c51ecfc78ab76daa5b5d6826e950ec39.jpg)
			- Supply of [[Bitcoin]] that <a href="https://en.macromicro.me/charts/32355/bitcoin-supply-last-active-1plus-years-ago">hasn't moved</a> for over 1 year
			- There's real recalcitrance about using the asset as a money, which potentially negatively impacts the security model[[Wouters2022]] and leads to:
		- ##### Reduction of funding source / liquidity in legacy finance
			- In the current financial system remuneration for labour performed in the  workforce is loaned into the money system, where it's put to work providing liquidity for creation of more opportunity. This system actually works pretty well. The more of this deferred labour that's taken out of the legacy system, the less work can be done with what remains. This isn't to say that [[Bitcoin]] will cause a [[Liquidity Crisis]], but there is possibly a cost if the current trend continues. This isn't as bad as:
		- ##### Bitcoin collapse system shock
			- In the event of an existential collapse of the [[Bitcoin]] network the erasure of so much capital would certainly have a contagion effect on the whole global financial system. It's hard to imagine what such an event could be, this being the nature of "[[Black Swan]]" events. One cited example is the unravelling of cryptography by [[Quantum Computing]]. Some conspiracy theorists in the past have even speculated that [[Bitcoin]] is itself a canary in the coal mine, engineered by the NSA to warn about emergent [[Quantum Computing]] somewhere in the world. It's all pretty silly because without cryptography [[Bitcoin]] would be the least of humanities problems. The risk of 'something' does exist though. The same anti-fragile feature can't be said about the technologies around [[Bitcoin]], which gives us:
		- ##### Stablecoin collapse system shock
			- This is much more likely. [[Stablecoins]] are under regulated, centralised, under collateralised, ponzi like structures, which could quite clearly fall apart at any point. The contagion effects of this are unclear as they're not yet too significant. They're a risk nonetheless, and may be an indicator of:
		- ##### Tech for techs sake yielding unexpected outcomes
			- The whole question of what [[Bitcoin]] addresses, whether it's been properly thought about, what the end goals are, and what the risks are is significant. It's a computer science and engineering solutions gone completely wild. It's clearly got benefits and there's clearly human appetite for this technology, but it's probably running ahead of the knowledge base around it. This is most exemplified in:
		- ##### No agreed measurable end goal
			- [[Bitcoin]] is a game theoretic juggernaut, where success of the network breeds more success for the network. The was obviously a great design choice for the computer scientists trying to solve the problem of a secure, and scalable, electronic cash, which couldn't be confiscated. Ironically for a global consensus mechanism it seems that nobody wants to discuss what constitutes a successful end point to this, and especially not what 'successful' endpoints for the game theory which have calamitous negative repercussions for wider society look like.[[warren2023bitcoin]] This might have implications for:
		- ##### National security / actual warfare
			- There's some national security implications for [[Bitcoin]] which are discussed both in the [fringes](https://twitter.com/JasonPLowery/status/1512775981693648897?) and the [sector media](https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/04/04/why-bitcoin-mining-is-a-matter-of-national-security/). Essentially, the industrial [[Mining]] complexes which are more commonplace now, are easily identifiable targets, and provide nations with both some leverage over the global network, and a considerable source of income. The [[IMF]] correctly identifies these facilities as a way for nation states to [monetise their energy reserves](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/GFSR/Issues/2022/04/19/global-financial-stability-report-april-2022) without the need for foreign markets, opening the door to sanction avoidance. In the case of smaller and developing nation states who are perhaps subject to financial penalties on the global stage for whatever reason, these facilities start to look like legitimate targets for cyber and conventional warfare. Lowry explain the potential strategic importance of [[Bitcoin]] in Softwar, [[Lowery2023]] though to be clear his motives are unclear and his thesis is neither peer reviewed nor publicly accessible. This 'weaponisation' of a neutral technology is already manifest in:
		- ##### Jurisdictional / legislative arbitrage
			- The reach of [[Bitcoin]] and it's ability to undercut the global money systems, delivering savings for those with a first mover advantage, and the current paucity of agreed legislation has set up an interesting and rare condition. [[Bitcoin]] encourages something called [[Jurisdictional Arbitrage]]; the race to take advantage of the variance in national approaches to the asset class. This section could perhaps be explored as a list of opportunities, but from the viewpoint of our SME business use case it's far more likely that these destabilising 'features' are risks:
				- **Difference in 'crypto' profit models**. Countries and jurisdictions can apply different charges for use of trading platforms and capital gains tax enjoys huge variance. Some countries are now competing to offer zero tax as a way to attract valuable tech mind share.
				- **Income tax** is harder to monitor in a truly international context. This is variously pitched around the world. It's hard to monitor this stuff and tax at source like with company employees wages, because it's basically designed to be hard to monitor. This results in:
				- **Passport perks**. Countries are already selling residence and company rights against [[Bitcoin]] marketing. There's a lot of new ways to buy passports and citizenship based on 'inclusion' in this community now. It's a terrible look. The early adopters can live international jetsetter lifestyles and ca benefit from:
				- **Business subsidies** such as those appearing in Switzerland, [Hondoras](https://davisclute.medium.com/visiting-a-startup-city-in-honduras-73d9c026ee6d), [[El Salvador]], Africa etc. This means a new divide is emerging since some countries are in instead applying:
				- **[[KYC]]/[[AML]]** rules which make onboarding into this technology harder. Currently there's a trend toward globally capturing information about people buying these assets, but it's effectively tech warfare now with engineers, rapidly producing tools to circumvent slow and varied legislation. The best example of this remains [[El Salvador]], where [[Bitcoin]] is legal tender, and has perhaps kickstarted:
				- **Bond issuances**. [[El Salvador]] are having a [faltering start](https://www.ft.com/content/4fa63c8c-51f5-4512-b522-76dd75e62916) to their promised bond issuance. It might be that all of this is a harbinger of the rise of:
				- **The [[Network State]]** is a proposal by [[Balaji Srinivasan]].[[Srinivasan2022]] His is a transhumanist thesis which he describes:
					- "The fundamental concept behind the [[Network State]] is to assemble a digital community and organise it to crowdfund physical territory. But that territory is not in one place — it's spread around the world, fully decentralized, hooked together by the internet for a common cause, much like Google's offices or [[Bitcoin]]'s miners. And because every citizen has opted in, it's a model for 100% democracy rather than the minimum threshold of consent modelled by 51% democracies."
		- ##### Hyperbitcoinization
			- All of the above starts to look like convergence on something the crypto community regularly describes to itself within it's internal media. [[Hyperbitcoinization]] is a term coined in 2014 by Daniel Krawisz.[[krawisz2014hyperbitcoinization]] It is the hypothetical rise of [[Bitcoin]] to become the global reserve currency, and the demonetisation of all other store of value assets. This seems unlikely but is hinted at in a game theoretic analysis of both [[Bitcoin]] and current macro economics. Again, [[Bitcoin]] is a likely very poor replacement for money. The ability to monetise assets through banks, backed by law and contracts (the debt based system), is a highly refined human concept, while [[Bitcoin]] is a fusion of Austrian economics, and a computer science project. The [[Hyperbitcoinization]] idea finds it's ultimate expression in Svalholm's "Everything Divided by 21 Million", a hypothetical re-accounting of all human production into the [[Bitcoin]] ledger.[[booth2022bitcoin]]
			- Nobody is sure what a [regular deflationary cycle](https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2022/07/inflation-and-deflation-with-a-fixed-money-supply/) might do to global supply chains. Malherbe et al. point out the inherent unsuitability of a deflationary asset such as [[Bitcoin]] as the global reserve currency[[malherbe2019cryptocurrencies]] and feel that perhaps other cryptocurrencies might be more suitable for adoption by governments. Interestingly this is the only paper to reference 'Duality' (the only thing purportedly written by [[Satoshi Nakamoto]] after they left the project).
			- Writer and activist [[Cory Doctorow]] is [not a fan of Bitcoin](https://onezero.medium.com/the-byzantine-premium-8411521db843). He provides an excellent summary of what he sees as the [basic societal mistake](https://doctorow.medium.com/finance-caused-the-fall-of-rome-fd091fa02973) of the libertarian ideals around strong property rights and hard money. In a hyper bitcoinised world where debt law would be enforced by distributed code, it might be far harder to prevent the "fall of Rome" scenario he describes. It is notable that he is also [strongly opposed](https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/09/autocomplete-worshippers/#the-real-ai-was-the-corporations-that-we-fought-along-the-way) to the current hype in AI and it's possible this is just his stock in trade.
			- Fulgur Ventures (a venture capital firm) provide a [blog post series](https://medium.com/@fulgur.ventures/the-roads-to-hyperbitcoinization-part-1-27dc84d0e5e5) about the route this might take. It's important to note that Budish suggested that the usefulness of [[Bitcoin]] (and blockchain) cannot exceed the cost to attack it. The is highly suggestive that [[Hyperbitcoinization]] is impossible.[[budish2018economic]] It's beyond the scope of this book to look at the implications of all this.

	- [[Non-fungible tokens]] are a whole 'class' of [[Digital assets]], separate and distinct from everything discussed to this point. They are generally[recognised inlaw](https://www.signaturelitigation.com/nfts-recognised-as-property-lavinia-deborah-osbourne-v-1-persons-unknown-2-ozone-networks-inc-trading-as-opensea/)as [[Digital property]] in their own right.[[moringiello2021property; @fairfield2021tokenized]] In the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) and [[Project tokens]] detailed earlier, and limiting this description to the [[Ethereum]] network for now, a project launching an [[ERC-20]] token commits contract code to the [[Blockchain]], and this contract then mediates the issuance and management of millions or billions of tokens associated with that project and its use case. [[ERC-20]](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) is a [fungible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungibility) token issuance. Each of the projects' tokens is interchangeable with any other token. They're all the same from the point of view of the user.
	- Rather than the [[ERC-20]] contract type used for fungible [[Token issuance]], [[NFT|NFTs]] predominantly use the [[ERC-721]] protocol on [[Ethereum]] (just different instructions). It's the case that most [[NFT|NFTs]] in the 2024-2025 market maturation phase are algorithmically generated sets of themed art (so-called [[PFP-NFT|Profile Picture NFTs]]). Tens of thousands of distinct tokens are 'minted', each one being a complex transaction commitment to the [[Ethereum]] blockchain, along with its associated [[Gas fees]]. These minting events were much-hyped social occasions (before the 2024 market consolidation), and happened very quickly, with users clamouring to create art with randomly allocated features from the art schema associated with the project. Lucky winners could find themselves with an [[NFT]] art piece with more than an average number of 'rare' features. If the overall mint becomes more popular, then the secondary market for all of those mints goes up, and because of the [[Liquidity premium]], they can go up a lot. The perceived rarer mints go up a lot more. This whole process is [very energy intensive](https://memoakten.medium.com/the-unreasonable-ecological-cost-of-cryptoart-2221d3eb2053) on the chain, and the vast majority of these projects simply trend to zero value. In response to scalability concerns, the [[Ethereum Foundation]] has proposed solutions to make [[NFT minting]] more efficient. Modern improvements include batch minting protocols allowing multiple tokens in single transactions.
	- The [[Ethereum]] Foundation provides their view of [[NFT|NFTs]] on their website and it's a useful primer. On that page, they detail some of the use cases, as listed below, with a critique added:
		- [[Digital content]]; this is the dominant use case in 2025. Much more on this later.
		- [[Gaming NFTs]]; again more on this later, it's an obvious enough use case but [[Complex policies]] in the intersection of [[Games]] and [[Cryptocurrency]] have influenced adoption curves.
		- [[Domain names]]; this is starting to reach mainstream applications in 2024-2025, with decentralized domain registries emerging.
		- [[Physical items]]; seemed like a clear over-reach as the transfer of the [[NFT]] does not imply the transfer of the object, but this is emerging as an important use case.
		- [[Digital investments]] and [[Collateral]]; while this was an emergent option in the space, historical market cycles have shown volatility. [[Liquidity]] providers and [[Risk management]] in [[Cryptocurrency]] continue to mature in 2025.
	- Moving away from [[Ethereum]], [[NFT|NFTs]] can be minted on most of the other [[Layer 1 blockchains]]. [[Solana]] is a notable example. [[Solana]] is centralised compared to [[Ethereum]], but thanks to that it's faster and cheaper to mint [[NFT|NFTs]] on it. The blockchain ecosystem in 2024-2025 shows increasing competition between [[Layer 1 blockchains|L1 chains]] for [[NFT]] market share. By 2025, the industry has seen consolidation with leading chains dominating based on [[Network effects]] and developer ecosystems.
	  ![image](./assets/c79e0ea22ab5fa6fac6fa22abbe87ab19f6ef244.jpg){:height 1068, :width 913}
	- [[Cardano]] offers technical advancements with [[ADA]], though competing [[Layer 1 blockchains|L1s]] struggle with diverse adoption. It's worth reiterating here that the nature of these [[Digital tools]] likely makes for a 'winner take all' market dynamic over time. With [[Transaction fees]] being central to [[NFT]] use cases, it's possible to see that highly optimised, fast, and economical chains will capture market share. The evolution toward 2025 shows increasing emphasis on [[Scalability solutions]] and [[Layer 2 networks]] to address [[Blockchain]] limitations.
	- Astonishingly, according to a JPMorgan insider market report ([reportedon in apodcast](https://www.coindesk.com/podcasts/the-breakdown-with-nlw/jpmorgan-bitcoin-shows-some-merit-as-a-store-of-value/)),only around 2 million people have ever actually interacted with NFTs.One analysis suggests that a single entity accounts for 3 of the top 4holders, having made 32,000 ETH from the NFT boom. This suggests heavymarket manipulation and is far from the egalitarian landscape claimed inthe hype. Tellingly it’s thought around [10% of the tradingvolume](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/three-arrows-wanted-100m-nft-161811450.html)on market leading platform ‘Super Rare’ was by the now bankrupt venturecapital firm ‘Three Arrows’.
	- With that said NFTs have clearly allowed [digital and new mediaartists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_non-fungible_tokens)to connect with audiences without gatekeepers. Established mediators andcurators of art have been caught totally wrongfooted, and NFTs seem togive a way for them to be cut out completely. There are suggestions ofapplications beyond this initial digital art scope. This is acompounding, and disrupting paradigm change.
- ## Key use cases
	- ### [[Digital Art]]
		- The recent surge of interest in [[NFT|NFT's]] during 2024-2025 has been largely driven by [[Digital art]] and [[Generative art]], building on foundations established since 2014. [[Digital artists]] like [[Kevin McCoy]] pioneered [[NFT art]], with his *Quantum* widely recognised as foundational work. By 2025, [[NFT]] art sales represent significant value in the [[Art market]]. High profile [[Digital artists]] such as [[Beeple]] helped bring [[NFT|NFT's]] into mainstream awareness through record-breaking sales. The [[Art community]] now widely uses [[Digital objects]] for [[Provenance]], [[Authenticity verification]], and [[Direct sales to collectors]].
		  ![image](./assets/348ebd1d1b622796f691fdcedc6d6207ec79739d.jpg)
		- [[Art]] as [[NFT|NFT's]] offer the following advantages:
			- ##### [[Immutable]] [[Authenticity]]
				- [[Art fraud]] such as false representation, [[Forgeries]], and [[Plagiarism]] have been a recurring issue. [[Artists]] and [[Artworks]] have been open to abuse by forgers. Unless a work is documented, the *nominal authenticity* can change over time. At its most basic level, once a work is 'minted' as an [[NFT]] on the [[Blockchain]], this functions as an immutable, publicly accessible proof of [[Ownership]] and creation. [[Minting]] is not limited to [[Digital art]]; any physical art (sculpture, painting, installation) can be represented digitally. [[NFT]] owners can possess the physical artwork alongside the [[Digital object]]. This provides secure, immutable [[Provenance]] for the [[Blockchain]] lifetime.
			- ##### [[Digital Provenance]]
				- [[Provenance]] (chain of custody) is crucial in [[Art]], [[Antiques]], and [[Collectibles]]. It helps assign work to artists and documents ownership history. [[Digital provenance]], an inherent feature of [[NFT|NFT's]], eliminates historical challenges in tracking [[Art ownership]]. The [[Blockchain]] serves as an open, secure [[Distributed ledger]] providing more trustworthy [[Provenance]] than traditional methods. [[Digital provenance]] allows [[Artists]] and [[Collectors]] to record secure, permanent, unalterable transaction history, providing future owners complete trust in [[Art ownership]] and [[Custody]].
			- ##### [[Decentralized]] [[Automated royalty payments|Royalty Automation]]
				- Traditionally, secondary and subsequent [[Art sales]] benefit only the buyer/collector, not the [[Artist]]. With [[NFT|NFT's]], [[Royalty payments]] can be [[Automated]] in perpetuity via [[Smart contracts]]. [[Smart contracts]] are automated scripts that execute predetermined conditions. [[Artist royalties]] can now be enforced through [[Smart contract]] logic, enabling the [[Creator economy]] to thrive. By 2025, many [[NFT]] platforms support [[Royalty enforcement]] at the protocol level.
			- ##### [[Royalty distribution]]
				- [[Royalty payments]] are automatically distributed to the [[Creator]] on each resale. Modern systems allow [[Artists]] and [[Collectors]] to benefit from [[Secondary markets]].
				- [[Smart contract]]-driven [[NFT|NFT's]] ensure that regardless of how many times a piece is resold across [[Collectors]], the [[Artist]] receives predetermined [[Royalty payments]] from each transaction.
				- Historically, [[Art provenance]] spans generations, but [[Traditional art markets]] rarely benefit [[Artists]]' descendants. [[NFT]] [[Smart contracts]] enable lasting [[Generational wealth transfer]]. As long as the creator's [[Digital wallet]] is accessible, the [[Blockchain]] becomes an everlasting [[Digital patron]].
				- NFT art currently suffers from the same failure of decentralisationalready discussed in the Ethererum technology stack, but this iscompounded by the normalisation of intermediate art brokers [continuingto custody](https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html)the NFTs even after sale. They are usually selling a pointer to theirown servers. The market is nascent and evolving, but it’s currently notdelivering on it’s core promise.
				- Proof of ownership is intuitively a pretty obvious application for thetechnology, but again it’s hard to justify the expense when the benefitsare so slim. [Bulldogs on theblockchain](https://www.bullishlybred.com/) is a clear gimmick, andmight even incentivise poor behaviours as there are two products herewhich are not necessarily aligned. Much has been written over the yearsabout [deeds to property](https://propy.com/browse/propy-nft/) beingpassed through blockchains, cutting out the middle man, but in the eventthat a house deed NFT was hacked and stolen it’s obviously not the casethat the property would then pass to the hacker.
				- One of the most interesting companies is Yuga Labs, who launched theincredibly popular Bored Ape Yacht club set of 10,000 algorithmicallygenerated NFTs. These Ethereum based NFTs were based loosely on the‘Crypto Punks’ model of PFP-NFT (variously profile picture project,picture for proof, and picture for profile
				- no definition remainsuncontested for long). Yuga launched with a better commercialisationmodel for the holders, and a strong marketing drive into celebritycircles. They now regularly change hands for hundreds of thousands ofpounds. Even this ‘blue chip’ NFT is not without [seriouscriticism](https://twitter.com/coryklippsten/status/1538909505236283392):it“I’d put it at 99.99% the project is in fact a deliberate troll,intentionally replete with Nazi symbols and esoteric racist dogwhistles”
				- Yuga recently bought the artistic rights to the commercial reuse ofsimilarly popular (and preceding) Punks set. This is interesting becausethey have again handed the commercial re-use rights to the owners of theindividual NFTs. This raises the same [confusingproblem](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-21/bored-ape-nft-spinoff-venture-gone-sour-sparks-legal-fight)with attaching commercial rights to an easily stolen token as NFTs forreal estate does. This has been demonstrated recently when Seth Greenhad a Bored Ape stolen after [creating an animated show around it’sIP](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/sarahemerson/seth-green-bored-ape-stolen-tv-show).Many more contradictions and ambiguities in NFT licences are emerging.Galaxy Digital have [surveyed thelandscape](https://www.galaxy.com/research/insights/a-survey-of-nft-licences-facts-and-fictions/):it“Contrary to the ethos of Web3, NFTs today convey exactly zeroownership rights for the underlying artwork to their token holders.Instead, the arrangements between NFT issuers and token holders resemblea distinctly web maze of opaque, misleading, complex, and restrictivelicensing agreements, and popular secondary markets like OpenSea provideno material disclosures regarding these arrangements to purchasers.Something more is required, and that ‘something’ is a legal agreementbetween the owner of the image—known as the ‘copyright holder’ and theNFT holder specifying what rights the NFT holder has with respect to theimage. To the extent an NFT purchaser has any rights to the imageassociated with his or her NFT at all, those rights flow not from his orher ownership of the token, but from the terms and conditions containedin the licence issued by the NFT Project governing the NFT holder’spurchase and use of the image. Accordingly, for the vast majority of NFTprojects, owning the NFT does not mean you own the corresponding digitalcontent that is displayed when you sync your wallet to OpenSea. Thatcontent, as it turns out, is owned and retained by the owner of thecopyright associated with that digital content, typically the NFTproject. After reviewing the most used licence agreements for NFTprojects, it becomes apparent that NFT standards and smart contracts donot recognise off-chain law.” There may already be a response from theindustry to this in the shape of [a16z’s “can’t be evil” licenseproposal](https://a16zcrypto.com/introducing-nft-licences/).
				- Even so, the community around these collections is incredibly strong,mixing developers, artists, the rich and famous, and the fortunate andearly, into a cohesive community who communicate online. The developer‘good will’ is enormous, and it seems possible that this will lead tofaster and broader innovation around the collections, and out into[metaverseapplications](https://twitter.com/yugalabs/status/1505014986556551172?).The brand is strong, and the individual NFT items both benefit from, andreinforce that brand, while adding personal narratives and humaninterest.
				- As a gauge of how frothy this market still is it’s interesting to lookat the APE token which Yuga just launched. They airdropped 10,000 of thetokens free to each of the 10,000 NFT holders. This instantly created amulti-billion dollar market cap, and a top 50 ‘crypto’ out of thin air,based purely on their brand. It’s clear that there is both brand, and amarket here.
				- A recent report from "Base Layer" tries to capture the community‘feature’ of big brand NFTs. [“Crypto culturedecoded”](https://baselayer.so/crypto-culture-decoded) explains that isis these online communities which are the attraction not necessarily theart. This is a powerful ‘in group’ argument, though speculation remainsthe most likely underpinning.
				- While it is likely that this is currently a speculative bubble, that is[waning already](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-61102759) (Figure<a href="#fig:monkey" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:monkey">[fig:monkey]</a>),it seems certain that the technology is here to stay in some form.

				- A global industry with revenues over £200b, with nearly half the people on the planet playing some form of [[Games]] in 2025.
				- As the [[Games industry]] has evolved, [[Secondary markets]] have emerged, most notably the [[Retro gaming]] and [[Used games]] resale market. The market for [[Gaming collectibles]] demonstrates lucrative opportunities for [[Private resellers]].
				- Despite publishers and developers moving to [[Digital-only games]], the demand for [[Used games]] remains incredibly high in 2025.
				- Whilst some retailers have adapted their business models to [[Reselling]] of [[Retro games]], the vast majority of [[Publishers]] and [[Developers]] aren't able to directly benefit from the emerging [[Secondary games market]]. The potential of [[Gaming NFTs]] and [[Digital game assets]] presents a huge opportunity for [[Publishers]], [[Developers]], and [[Players]], offering the following advantages:
			- ##### [[Royalty sales]] on [[Pre-owned games]]
				- A predetermined proportion of any resale of a [[Used game]] can be automated in perpetuity via [[Smart contracts]]. Traditionally only the initial first sale benefits [[Publishers]]/[[Developers]], with secondary sales only benefiting the [[Purchaser]]. However, [[Smart contract]]-driven [[Gaming NFTs]] mean that if a [[Game]] is sold/resold through thousands of [[Collectors]], a pre-determined [[Royalty payment]] rate set by the [[Publisher]] is automatically distributed on every future sale.
			- ##### [[User-generated content]] [[Monetization]]
				- [[Gaming NFTs]] offer ability to monetize [[User-generated content]]. Major [[Video games]] like [[Pokemon Go]], [[Destiny 2]], and [[Genshin Impact]] have massive established player bases in 2025. These games are designed to encourage extensive play; top players have amassed thousands of hours. By 2025, the opportunity to monetize [[Player-created content]] and [[In-game assets]] through [[NFT|NFTs]] represents significant economic potential.
				- Destiny/Pokemon Go and Genshin Impact revolve around a central key gamemechanic; players investing significant amounts of time collecting ingame digital assets; characters/weapons/items, often classed as ‘rare’or ‘exotic’ or ‘5 Star’. These collectibles usually found by acombination of the accrual of in-game time, completing quests,purchasing additional in-game items/boosters, and luck (‘RNG’). Playersare often encouraged to share their collections of rarecharacters/weapons/ objects through in-game achievements, triumphs,scores acting as a mark of distinction/status symbol.
				- Traditionally there has been nothing that went beyond sharing the*digital badge* (i.e triumph/achievement/accomplishment) on a on socialmedia/gamer’s platform profile. However NFT’s offer the ideal system fordevelopers/publishers and even players to monetise usergenerated/customised data (such as a players unique save game data),simultaneously allowing: a) creation of an additional monetisedecosystem to meet player demands i.e. some players who are willing tomonetise and ‘sell’ their invested time in a particular product/serviceto other players with little time but willing to pay other players for‘grinding’ (progressing laborious in game tasks) and a more advancedin-game progression point. The potential to providepublishers/developers with an additional long-term income stream,providing a better ROI on computer & video game development, which inmany instances can cost hundreds of millions in development costsspanning 5/10 years, is undeniable.
				- This use case is where our focus lies, as it is now far easier for users to generate content with the support of AI. Note that ideas also can count as content.
			- ##### [[Play-to-earn]] [[Revenue models]]
				- [[Play-to-earn]] models represent an evolution in [[Game economics]], though market conditions in 2024-2025 show cautious development. Structural issues in [[Web3 gaming]] economics continue to be studied and refined. [[Bot]] activity and [[Market manipulation]] remain concerns in early-stage [[Play-to-earn]] systems.
			- ##### [[In-game collectibles]] [[Monetization]]
				- [[Customizable in-game assets]] including [[Cosmetic items]] and [[Collectible items]] that offer [[Player advantages]] can be tokenized as [[Gaming NFTs]].
				- Traditional gamers have pushed back on the seemingly useful idea ofintegrating NTFs with traditional games. This may be in part becauseEthereum mining has kept graphics card prices high for a decade.

					- Justin Kan, co-founder of twitch: it“NFTs are a better business modelfor games. Many gamers seem to be raging hard against game studiosselling NFTs. But NFTs are also better for players. Here’s why I thinkblockchain games will be the predominant business model in gaming in tenyears. NFTs are a better business model for funding games . Example:recently I invested in a new web3 game SynCityHQ. They are building amafia metaverse and raised $3M in their initial NFT drop.  NFTs give studios access to a new capital market for raising capitalfrom the crowd.NFTs can be a better ongoing model for games. Web3 gameswill open economies, and by building the games on open and programmableassets (tokens + NFTs) they will create far more economic value thanthey could from any one game. Imagine Fortnite, but other developers canbuild experiences on top of the V-Bucks and skins. Epic would get aroyalty every time any transaction happens. As big as Fortnite is today,Open Fortnite could be much bigger, because it will be a true platform.NFTs are better for gamers Allowing gamers to have ownership of theassets they buy and earn in game allows them to participate in thepotential growth of a game. It lets gamers preserve some economic valuewhen they switch to playing something new. But what about the criticismsof NFTs?  Here are my thoughts on the common FUDs: "It’s just a money grab on thepart of the studios!"  Game studios already switched over to the model of selling in-gameitems, cosmetics, etc to players long ago. But currently the digitalstuff players are buying isn’t re-sellable. NFT ownership is strictlybetter for players. "The games aren’t real games." This reminds me ofthe criticism of free-to-play in 2008, when the games were Mafia Wars /FarmVille. We haven’t had time for great developers to create incredibleexperiences yet. Everyone investing in games knows there are great teamsbuilding. "Game NFTs aren’t really decentralized because they rely onmodels / assets inside centralised game clients." Crypto is as much amovement as it is a technology. Putting items on a blockchain is whatgives people trust that they have participatory ownership...which makepeople willing to buy in to the game. These assets are “backed” byblockchain. The fact that these item collections are NFTs will makeother people willing to build on top of them. "NFTs are bad for theenvironment." Solana and L2s solve this. NFT games are better forplayers and for game developers. Like the free-to-play revolutionchanged gaming, so will blockchain. The games of the future will befully robust, with open and programmable economies.”
			- ### [[Broader digital object uses]] and [[Metaverse]] applications
				- By 2025, [[NFT|NFTs]] and [[Digital objects]] are categorised into diverse use cases:
					- [[Profile pictures|PFP NFTs]]: Originally popular on [[Social media]], these identity-based [[Digital collectibles]] have evolved into more sophisticated [[Avatar systems]] for [[Metaverse]] environments. The intersection of [[Social identity]] and [[Virtual worlds]] is a growing area.
					- [[Digital music]] and [[Music NFTs]]: [[Artists]] are using [[NFT|NFTs]] to distribute [[Music rights]] and [[Royalties]] directly to fans. Platforms are experimenting with [[Music NFTs]] and [[Creator economy]] models. [[Music]] represents a [[Creator economy]] opportunity where [[Artists]] can distribute value directly to [[Audiences]].
					- [[Gaming]]: Major companies including [[Lego]], [[Blizzard]], [[Epic]], and [[Ubisoft]] are investing in [[Gaming NFTs]] as of 2025.
					- [[Event tickets]] and [[Digital memorabilia]]: [[NFT]] tickets enable [[Event organizers]] to collect [[Royalties]] on [[Secondary market]] sales. [[Sporting events]] and [[Concerts]] are increasingly using [[Digital tickets]] and [[Collectible memorabilia]].
						- *[[Royalty]] models allow [[Event organizers]] to benefit from [[Ticket appreciation]]. [[Smart contracts]] enable automatic [[Commission distribution]] on resales.*
				- [[Virtual event tickets]] and [[Metaverse]] events represent growth areas for 2025.
					- [[Membership tokens]]: [[Utility NFTs]] and [[Access tokens]] allow [[Membership programmes]] and [[Exclusive communities]].
					- [[Virtual property]] and [[Metaverse]] applications: [[NFT|NFTs]] are crucial for [[Metaverse]] development. [[Virtual real estate]], [[Digital land]], and [[Immersive environments]] increasingly use [[Digital objects]] for ownership and trading by 2025.
					- [[Luxury brands]] and [[Physical-digital hybrids]]: By 2025, major [[Luxury goods]] companies integrate [[NFT|NFTs]] with [[Physical products]]. [[Phygital]] (physical + digital) strategies enable brands to prove [[Authenticity]], create [[Secondary markets]], and connect with [[Metaverse]] experiences. [[Luxury provenance]] is enhanced through [[Blockchain]] technology.
				- It is completely reasonable to assert that these use cases could be accomplished without the use of NFT technology, and is part of the hype bubble.
				- Twitter user Cantino.Eth offers an exhaustive roundup of what they think future uses might be. It’s a [thread full of industry insider jargon](https://twitter.com/chriscantino/status/1542930648750608387)) but it’s indicative of a shift in focus from speculation to ‘building’ asthe market conditions change.
				- {{twitter https://twitter.com/chriscantino/status/1542930648750608387)}}
				- Use cases identified for 2025 and beyond:
					- [[Hobby tokens]]: Demonstrating interest in activities. This serves to drive [[Community formation]] and [[Social signaling]].
					- [[Professional credentials]]: [[Qualification NFTs]] and [[Professional badges]] for [[Skill verification]] and [[Credentials]].
					- [[Membership badges]]: [[Distributed project]] participation and [[Community affiliation]] tokens.
					- [[Loyalty programmes]]: [[Retail incentives]], [[Brand loyalty]], and [[Early access programmes]] enabled through [[NFT|NFTs]].
					- [[Community challenges]]: [[Collective milestones]] and [[Team-based incentive]] programmes.
					- [[User-generated content]] [[Monetization]]: [[Content creator]] [[Royalties]] and [[IP rights]] management.
					- [[Soulbound tokens]]: Non-transferable [[Account-bound NFTs]] for [[Reputation]], [[Achievements]], and [[Identity verification]].
					- [[Educational credentials]]: [[Skill certificates]] and [[Verified learning]] records on the [[Blockchain]].
					- [[Smart contract]]–based ownership: [[Digital contracts]], [[Conditional ownership]], and [[Asset transfer]] logic enabled through [[Blockchain]] integration.
- ### [[Digital objects]] in collaborative [[Mixed reality]] applications
	- By 2025, there has been a shift toward [[Digital objects]] terminology and away from purely [[NFT]] branding. [[Digital objects]] are considered crucial for [[Metaverse]] development. [[Avatar collectibles]] and [[Digital assets]] in [[Virtual worlds]] are increasingly mainstream.
	- Multiple platforms provide paths to [[Digital assets]]:
	- #### [[Bitcoin]] layer solutions
		- [[Liquid Network]]: A mature [[Bitcoin sidechain]] developed by [[Blockstream]], enabling [[Asset issuance]] and [[Token creation]]. [[Liquid]] offers [[Privacy]] and [[Scalability]] improvements while maintaining [[Bitcoin]] security.
		- [[Bitcoin ordinals]]: [[Satoshi inscriptions]] enable [[Digital artefact]] storage directly on the [[Bitcoin blockchain]], providing [[Immutability]] and [[Security]].
		- [[Taproot assets]]: Next-generation [[Asset issuance]] protocol leveraging [[Taproot]] for [[Privacy]] and [[Efficiency]].
	- #### [[Ethereum]]
		- Despite scalability challenges, [[Ethereum]] maintains the largest [[NFT]] ecosystem. [[Layer 2 solutions]] like [[Optimism]] and [[Arbitrum]] provide improved [[Scalability]].
	- #### [[Alternative layer 1 blockchains]]
		- [[Solana]]: Fast and cheap, but [[Centralized]]. [[Solana]] suffered from the [[FTX]] exchange collapse, affecting [[Asset]] confidence.
		- [[Cardano]]: Offers technical improvements but faces [[Network effects]] challenges.
	- #### [[Peerswap]]
		- [[Submarine swaps]] and [[Liquidity rebalancing]] protocols enable asset transfer between [[Liquid]] and other [[Bitcoin]] layers. This is an active area of development in 2025.
	- #### [[FROST]] on [[Bitcoin]]
		- [[FROST]] (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold) enables [[Threshold signatures]] and multi-sig arrangements on [[Bitcoin]]. This allows [[Collaborative custody]] and [[Shared ownership]] of [[UTXO|UTXOs]].
	- #### [[Spacechains]]
		- [[Spacechains]] provide a clean method for [[Asset issuance]] using [[Bitcoin]] as the base layer. New [[Spacechains]] inherit [[Bitcoin's security]] through [[Mining]]. By 2025, spacechains are approaching [[Mainnet]] readiness.
	- #### [[RGB Protocol]]
		- [[RGB]] is a sophisticated [[Smart contract]] protocol for [[Bitcoin]] and [[Taproot]]. It enables [[Client-side validation]], [[Privacy]] through [[Zero-knowledge proofs]], and efficient [[Asset]] management. [[RGB]] is the planned solution for [[Digital objects]] requiring complex logic.
	- ##### [[BRC-20 tokens]]
		- [[BRC-20]] are [[Fungible tokens]] created by attaching [[JSON]] data to [[Satoshis]] through [[Bitcoin ordinals]]. The community is split on [[BRC-20]] usage and its impact on [[Bitcoin transaction fees]]. For [[Fungible assets]], [[BRC-20]] offers advantages over [[ERC-20]] in [[Simplicity]], [[Security]], and [[Fair minting processes]]. By 2025, [[BRC-20]] adoption has stabilized with clearer fee market dynamics.
	- ##### [[Litecoin]], [[Vertcoin]], and other chains
		- [[Bitcoin forks]] and [[Alternative networks]] can implement [[Ordinals]]-based [[Asset issuance]]. [[Litecoin]] serves as a [[Technical testbed]] for [[Bitcoin]] innovations. By 2025, multiple chains experiment with [[Inscription]] protocols and [[Digital artefacts]].
		- [Runes on Litecoin! : r/litecoin (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/1ckwnu6/runes_on_litecoin/)
	- #### [[Bitcoin Ordinals]], [[Inscriptions]], and [[RUNES]]
		- [[Bitcoin ordinals]] enable [[Digital artefact]] storage directly on the [[Bitcoin blockchain]], offering [[Security]], [[Immutability]], and [[Decentralization]]. The [[Taproot]] upgrade allows efficient [[Large file storage]] on [[Bitcoin]]. By 2025, ordinals have matured as a viable [[Asset]] protocol.
		- [[Digital artefacts]] represent a higher standard than traditional [[NFT|NFTs]]: they are [[Decentralized]], [[Immutable]], [[On-chain]], and [[Unrestricted]]. Unlike many [[NFT|NFTs]] with [[Off-chain storage]], ordinals provide complete [[On-chain]] [[Digital object]] integrity.
			- *[[Inscriptions]] are stored entirely on [[Bitcoin]], the oldest, most [[Decentralized]], most [[Secure blockchain]]. They require no [[Smart contract]] audits and represent true [[Digital artefacts]].*
		- [[Ordinals]] track individual [[Satoshis]] using [[Ordinal theory]], ascribing [[Non-fungible]] properties to [[Satoshis]]. [[Inscriptions]] can contain diverse [[Digital content]]: [[Images]], [[Audio]], [[Video]], [[PDFs]], and even [[Interactive content]]. Ownership is transferred by spending the [[UTXO]] containing the [[Satoshi]], not the data itself, which remains linked to the original ordinal.
		- The [[Bitcoin]] community has debated [[Ordinals]] usage and its impact on [[Block space utilization]]. [[Inscription]] costs are measured in [[Satoshis]] per byte. By 2025, fee market dynamics have adjusted to accommodate [[Ordinals]] and other [[Bitcoin data protocols]].
		- Case studies of [[Digital artefact migration]] between blockchains raise important questions about [[Ownership]] rights, [[IP]] retention, and [[Legal frameworks]] for [[Digital objects]]. The relationship between [[NFT]] holders and [[Smart contracts]] is still evolving.
		- [[Blockchain scalability]] considerations impact [[Ordinals]] viability. [[Pruned nodes]] and [[Archival nodes]] allow participation at different [[Data storage]] levels. By 2025, [[Node infrastructure]] has evolved to accommodate larger blockchain sizes. [[Lightning Network]] provides scalability solutions.
		- There is also likely to be a considerable impact on the size of the **full** Bitcoin blockchain where the approach to become commonplace. What was a 500 gigabyte file with a fairly linear growth rate might likely become many terabytes over the coming years. The overall workaround for this would be ‘pruned nodes’ vs ‘archival nodes’, similar to the Ethereum approach, with those likely only run in places where prosecutions for illegal data on the chain seem unlikely. Curiously this won’t effect users of the system who choose to run their own nodes, asthe software is configured to throw away this extraneous data prior to the timestamp of the last software upgrade. Concerns that this might price out participation from emerging markets are overblown from an infrastructure point of view, but potentially valid from a fee competition standpoint. This perhaps drives Lightning adoption. Nobody seems too sure, though Kaloudis, senior researcher at Coindesk describes the tradeoffs and tensions at this time.[[Kaloudis2023]] As seems to be the norm now, there is [Nostr integration](https://nosft.xyz/) coming to Ordinals.
		- [[Major NFT projects]] like [[Yuga Labs]] have moved into the [[Bitcoin ordinals]] space by 2025. This demonstrates the [[Migration]] of established [[NFT]] projects to [[Bitcoin-based]] models, emphasising [[Self-custody]] and [[True ownership]] principles.
		- [[PSBT|Partially signed Bitcoin transactions (PSBTs)]] enable [[Collaborative Bitcoin]] transactions. By 2025, [[PSBT]] support has expanded, facilitating [[Multi-sig]] arrangements and enabling [[Secure ordinal transfer]].
		- [[Bitcoin ordinal wallets]] like [[Unisat]] provide browser-based access to [[BRC-20]] tokens and [[NFT|NFTs]]. By 2025, wallet infrastructure has matured to support both [[Fungible]] and [[Non-fungible]] [[Digital assets]] on [[Bitcoin]].
		- For complex [[Metaverse]] use cases, [[RGB Protocol]] is the preferred solution, offering [[Privacy]] through [[Zero-knowledge proofs]], [[Client-side validation]], and [[Peer-to-peer verification]]. [[RGB]] provides the [[Smart contract]] sophistication needed for advanced [[Digital objects]].
		- [[RUNES]], created by [[Rodarmor]], enable [[Fungible token]] issuance on [[Bitcoin]]. This represents an evolution from [[Ordinals]] for [[Fungible assets]]. By 2025, [[RUNES]] have become a significant part of the [[Bitcoin]] asset ecosystem, with implications for [[Transaction fees]].

- # Surveillance Capitalism
	- Surveillance capitalism is a term coined by Harvard Business School professor Shoshana Zuboff to describe the business model of using data collected from individuals to target advertising and influence behaviour. The concept of surveillance capitalism emerged in the late 20th and early 21st centuries with the rise of technology companies thatspecialize in gathering and analysing personal data.
	- The history of surveillance capitalism can be traced back to the early days of the internet. In the 1990s, companies such as DoubleClick andOmniture began collecting data on internet users’ browsing habits inorder to target advertising. As the internet grew in popularity, these companies were able to gather an increasing amount of data on individuals, allowing them to more effectively target advertising and increase profits.
	- The advent of smart phones and mobile technology in the 2000s further expanded the reach of surveillance capitalism. With the widespread adoption of smart phones and mobile apps, companies were able to collect even more data on individuals, including location data and information about their physical activity. This data was used to target advertising and influence behaviour, leading to the rise of companies such as Google and Facebook, which have become dominant players in the digital advertising market.
	- The use of data collected from individuals to influence behaviour has also been used to influence political campaigns. In the 2016 USpresidential election, Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics firm, used data collected from Facebook users to influence voter behaviour. The firm used the data to target advertising and create psychological profiles of individuals, allowing them to more effectively influence voter behaviour.
	- The business model of surveillance capitalism has been widely criticised for its ethical implications. Critics argue that the collection and useof personal data without consent is a violation of individuals’ privacyand that the use of data to influence behaviour is manipulative and unethical. In recent years, there have been calls for greater regulationof the tech industry to address these concerns.
	- Surveillance capitalism has led to significant compliance overheads for companies that collect and use personal data. There are a number of laws and regulations that have been put in place to protect individuals’ privacy, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in theEuropean Union and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) inCalifornia, USA. These laws require companies to obtain consent from individuals before collecting and using their data, and to provide individuals with the right to access, correct, and delete their data.
	- Complying with these laws can be costly and time-consuming for companies. They may need to hire additional staff to handle data privacy compliance, and may also need to invest in new technology to manage andprotect personal data. In addition, companies are at risk of significant fines if they fail to comply with these laws.
	- In terms of who profits from surveillance capitalism, the primary beneficiaries are technology companies such as Google and Facebook,which have become dominant players in the digital advertising market.These companies collect and analyse large amounts of personal data,which they use to target advertising and influence behaviour. This allows them to generate significant profits from advertising revenue.
	- On the other hand, those who suffer the most negative impact from surveillance capitalism are individuals, whose personal data is collected and used without their consent. They are also at risk of theirprivacy being violated, and their personal data being misused. Additionally, the collection and use of personal data can lead to themanipulation of individuals’ behaviour and decision-making, which can have negative consequences for their lives and society at large.
	- Moreover, the business model of surveillance capitalism has also been criticized for creating a power imbalance between companies and individuals. Companies have access to vast amounts of personal data,which they can use to influence behaviour and make decisions that affect individuals’ lives. This can lead to a lack of privacy and autonomy for individuals, and can also lead to discrimination and bias indecision-making.
	- This is collectively an erosion of the demarcation between data, state surveillance, banking, and political leadership globally.
	- The term "surveillance state" refers to a state in which government agencies have the power to collect and analyse large amounts of personal data, often without the consent of individuals. The rise of surveillance capitalism has led to concerns about the potential for the creation of a surveillance state, as government agencies may use the data collected by companies for surveillance purposes.
	- There have been instances where government agencies have used data collected by companies for surveillance purposes. For example, in theUnited States, the National Security Agency (NSA) has been accused of using data collected by companies such as Google and Facebook for surveillance purposes. The agency’s PRISM program, which was revealed byEdward Snowden in 2013, was designed to collect and analyse data from internet companies in order to identify and track individuals. Europe is[clear about it’sintentions](https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/posts/chat-control/) to mandate their complete access to all encrypted personal communications in forthcoming legislation.
	- The use of data collected by companies for surveillance purposes canhave significant implications for individuals’ privacy and civil liberties. It can also lead to a lack of transparency and accountability, as government agencies may use the data without the knowledge or consent of individuals. In addition, the use of data for surveillance purposes can lead to discrimination and bias indecision-making, as well as a chilling effect on free speech and the exercise of other rights.
	- Akten has been [talkingabout](https://memoakten.medium.com/all-watched-over-by-machines-of-loving-grace-8c2464aa6fda)the phase transition from digital surveillance to pernicious corporateAI in terms of a modern ‘religion’ for many years.[[bayer2023artificial]]He feels that despite public awareness of privacy invasion, there hasbeen no significant outcry or unanimous demand for privacy. Instead,most individuals seem to find comfort in the belief that a higher forceis watching and protecting the virtuous, while punishing wrongdoers. The concept of a ‘digital deity’ emerge from his thinking in this context,reflecting the role that religion and traditional gods have played in providing ethical frameworks, security, discipline, power, and other societal functions. More recently O’Gieblyn has been drawing the same conclusions,[[o2021god]] explicitly linking religiosity to the imperative to ‘create a godhead’ simply because it can be done, not pausing to discuss if it should be. Rosenberg calls this ‘a threat to EpistemicAgency’[[rosenbergmanipulation]]More recently the Harari, author ofSapiens[[harari2014sapiens]] [said ofAI](https://forumlive.frontiersin.org/agenda/speakers/2977577): it“For thousands of years, prophets and poets and politicians have used language and storytelling in order to manipulate and to control people and to reshape society. Now AI is likely to be able to do it. And once it can... it doesn’t need to send killer robots to shoot us. It can get humans to pull the trigger. We need to act quickly before AI gets out ofour control. Drug companies cannot sell people new medicines without first subjecting these products to rigorous safety cheques.” (AI will be discussed in detail in a later chapter).
	- Klein at the New York Times has been [writing against thispoint](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/12/opinion/chatbots-artificial-intelligence-future-weirdness.html)for some time. His well articulated fear, is that the current model where three major Western companies, with similar highly competitive capitalist origins and values, should certainly not be in charge ofracing to monetise the most compelling and innately unknowable chat bot experience. As societies shift towards materialism and technological dependence, traditional gods lose their relevance, and the need for anew form of overseer arises. This digital deity, existing within therealm of technology and the cloud, perhaps represents an adaptation of primal human belief systems. This will be explored further in the AI/MLchapter later.
	- In conclusion, the rise of surveillance capitalism has led to concerns about the potential for the creation of a surveillance state, or worse,a new kind of omnipresent digital culturla authority. Corporations and government agencies may use the data collected by companies for surveillance purposes. This can have significant implications for individuals’ privacy and civil liberties. It’s important for laws and regulations to be in place to safeguard citizens’ rights and privacy inregards to the use of data by government agencies, and to hold them accountable for any misuse of data, and yet it seems the reality of the situation in ‘post Snowden’ seems far from that.
	- Surveillance Capitalism. As a quick round-up of this area, which is best researched elsewhere:
		- The global digital advertising market is expected to reach $335 billion by 2023.
		- In 2020, Google and Facebook accounted for 60% of the global digital advertising market.
		- The data brokerage industry, which includes companies that collect and sell personal data, is estimated to be worth $200 billion.
		- In 2020, Google and Facebook were reported to have data on over 4 billion active users.
		- As of 2021, the number of data breaches reported worldwide has grown from 4.1 billion in 2018 to 4.9 billion in 2020.
		- In 2013, it was revealed that the US National Security Agency (NSA) had been collecting the phone records of millions of Americans under its PRISM program.
		- In 2013, Edward Snowden leaked classified documents that revealed the scale of the NSA’s surveillance programmes.
		- In the US, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) allows the government to conduct surveillance on non-US citizens outside the US without a warrant.
		- The UK’s Investigatory Powers Act 2016, also known as the "snooper’s charter," gives government agencies wide-ranging powers to collect and analyse personal data.
		- In 2021, it was reported that the Chinese government has been collecting and analysing the data of its citizens through a system of "social cred* scores, which are used to monitor and control individuals’ behaviour.
		- Surveillance capitalism refers to the business model of collecting and analysing personal data for the purpose of targeted advertising and other forms of monetization.
		- A recent study by the Centre for Digital Democracy found that the top 100 global digital media companies are projected to generate over $1 trillion in revenue by 2020, much of which is derived from surveillance-based advertising.
		- The number of surveillance cameras in use worldwide is estimated to be over 1 billion, with the majority located in China.
		- A 2018 study by Comparitech found that the average person in the UK is captured on CCTV cameras over 300 times per day.
		- According to a report by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the FBI has access to over 640 million photographs for facial recognition searches, including driver’s licence and passport photos.
		- The U.S. government’s use of surveillance technologies, such as drones and mass data collection, has been a subject of ongoing controversy and debate.
		- Some experts warn that the increasing use of surveillance technologies by governments and private companies could lead to the erosion of privacy rights and the creation of a *surveillance state."
		- In the USA senate hearing following the collapse of FTX Rep. Jesus Garcia described bitcoin and crypto as an industry that operates outside of the law and relies on hype, implying that the communities that have adopted bitcoin are ill-informed and vulnerable.
		- Bitcoin has been adopted by a variety of communities worldwide, particularly in countries such as Vietnam, the Philippines, Ukraine, India, Pakistan, Brazil, Thailand, Russia, and China.
		- There is an outsized level of adoption among Black Americans in the United States. This trend is not a result of targeted advertising by companies such as FTX, but rather a response to a legacy financial system that has limited individuals’ potential.
		- Marginalized early adopters of bitcoin still constitute a minority in their communities, but the worldwide adoption trend among these groups is on the rise.
		- The solutions that outsiders build in bitcoin will ultimately be the source of the technology’s promised revolution. Adoption in Africa and possibly India seems likely to be capable of driving this.
		- The paradigm shift will come from those who bring local, real-world focused use cases to their communities, separating bitcoin from the empty hype of speculation.
		- Marginalized communities will lead the industry’s recovery and redefine the purpose of bitcoin in the future.

		- Big Tech firms donate substantial funds to charities, think tanks, academic research, and lobbying efforts to shape narratives and policy around tech regulation. [[Goldenfein Mann 2024]]
		- Tracking financial flows from Big Tech to DRCSOs is challenging due to limited transparency, but available data shows ongoing funding relationships.
		- Through class action cy pres settlements, Big Tech firms direct funds to DRCSOs that purport to represent class interests, but may actually advance the firms' preferred policy narratives.
		- Funding from Big Tech raises questions about potential conflicts of interest for DRCSOs and whether they truly represent the public interest as opposed to aligning with industry agendas.
		- The authors argue Big Tech philanthropy allows economic power to translate into political and cultural capital, enabling the firms to continue profiting from problematic data practices while avoiding meaningful regulation.
		- Much of the following text is paraphrased from the work of Guy Turner of‘The Coin Bureau’, and Lawyer and academic Eden Moglen, and needs more work because of it’s critical importance to the book. [[Update Cycle]]
			- The adoption of printing by Europeans in the 15th century led to concerns around access to printed material. The right to read and the right to publish were central subjects in the struggle for freedom of thought for most of the last half millennium. The basic concern was forthe right to read in private and to think, speak, and act based on a free and uncensored will. The primary antagonist for freedom of thought at the beginning of this struggle was the universal Catholic Church, an institution aimed at controlling thought in the European world through weekly surveillance of individuals, censorship of all reading material,and the ability to predict and punish unorthodox thought. In early modern Europe, the tools available for thought control were limited, but they were effective. For hundreds of years, the struggle centred around the book as a mass-manufactured article in Western culture, and whether individuals could print, possess, traffic, read, or teach from books without the permission or control of an entity empowered to punish thought. By the end of the 17th century, censorship of written material in Europe began to break down in waves throughout the European world,and the book became an article of subversive commerce, undermining the control of thought.
		- Currently, a new phase in human history is beginning as we are building a single extraneous digital nervous system, that will connect every human mind. Within two generations, every single human being will be connected to this network, in which all thoughts, plans, dreams, and actions will flow as nervous impulses. The fate of freedom of thought and human freedom as a whole will depend upon the organization of thisnetwork. Our current generation is the last in which human brains will be formed without contact with this network, and from now on, every human brain will be formed from early life in direct connection to the network, with input from generative AI/ML systems. This possibly results in humanity becoming a super organism of a sort, where each of us is buta neuron in the brain. Unfortunately, this generation has been raised to be consumers of media, which is now consuming us.
		- Anonymous reading is being determined against. Efforts discussed throughout this graph to ensure privacy, from Zimmerman and the cypherpunks onward, have been met with resistance from government efforts to monitor and control information flow. The outcome of the organization of this network, and the freedom it allows, is currently being decided by this generation.
		- It is not solely the ease of surveillance, nor solely the permanence of data, that is concerning, it is the relentless nature of living after the “end of forgetting”. Today’s encrypted traffic, which is used with relative security, will eventually be decrypted as more data becomes available for crypto analysis. This means that security protocols will need to be constantly updated and redone. Furthermore, no information is ever truly lost, and every piece of information can be retained and eventually linked to other information. This is the rationale behind government officials who argue that a robust social graph of the UnitedStates is needed. The primary form of data collection that should be of most concern is media that is used to spy on us, such as books that watch us read them and search boxes that report our searches to unknown parties. There is a lot of discussion about data coming out ofMeta/Facebook, but the true threat is code going in. For the past 15years, enterprise computing has been adding a layer of analytics on topof data warehouses, which is known as business intelligence. This allows for the vast amount of data in a company’s possession to be analysed and used to answer questions the company did not know it had. The real threat of Facebook is the business intelligence layer on top of theFacebook data warehouse, which contains the behaviour of nearly a billion people. Intelligence agencies from around the world want toaccess this layer in order to find specific classes of people, such as potential agents, sources, and individuals that can be influenced or tortured. The goal is to run code within Facebook to extract this information, instead of obtaining data from Facebook, which would be dead data once extracted. Facebook wants to be a media company andcontrol the web, but the reality is the true value of Facebook is the information and behaviour of it’s users, and the ability to mine that data. Distributed internet protocols are important in the context of government overreach into digital society and people’s private livesbecause they provide a level of decentralization and resilience that canhelp protect against censorship and surveillance.
		- For example, if a government were to attempt to censor or block access to a centralised internet service, it could potentially do so with relative ease. However, if that same service were distributed across anetwork of nodes, it would be much more difficult for the government to effectively censor or block access to it.
		- Another advantage of distributed protocols is that they are typically more resilient to attacks or failures. If one node in the network goes offline or is compromised, the others can continue to operate, ensuring that the service remains available. This can be especially important in situations where the internet is being used for critical communication,such as during a natural disaster or political crisis.
		- In addition to their benefits for censorship resistance and resilience,distributed protocols can also help protect people’s privacy. Because they do not rely on centralised servers or infrastructure, they can bemore difficult for governments or other entities to monitor or track.This can be especially important in countries where government surveillance is prevalent or where individuals may be at risk of persecution for their online activities.
		- There are a number of distributed protocols that have been developed specifically to address issues of censorship and privacy, and these will be covered in more detail later.
		- It is important to note that distributed protocols are not a silver bullet for censorship or privacy concerns. They can be vulnerable to certain types of attacks, such as those that target the nodes of the network, and they may not always be practical for certain types of applications. However, they do provide an important tool for those seeking to protect their freedom of expression and privacy online. They offer a valuable tool for those seeking to protect their freedom of expression and privacy online, and they will likely continue to play a critical role in the future of the internet.
		- In recent years, several countries have proposed or passed bills that would result in unprecedented levels of online censorship. One such example is Canada’s Bill C-11, also known as the Online Streaming Act.This bill was first proposed in November 2020 as Bill C-10, but failed to pass due to its controversial provisions. It was reintroduced inFebruary 2021 as Bill C-11 and was approved by the Canadian House ofCommons, the first step in the process of becoming law. If passed, the bill would give the Canadian Radio, Television and TelecommunicationsCommission (CRTC) the power to decide what content Canadians can view onYouTube and other social media platforms. The CRTC would also have the power to dictate what content creators can produce, with a focus on promoting "Canadian content." Additionally, the bill would require certain broadcasters to contribute to the Canada Media Fund, which is used to fund mainstream media in Canada. The bill is currently being considered by the Canadian Senate, which will vote on it in February. If passed, it will then be debated by the Canadian Parliament. Tech companies such as YouTube have reportedly failed to convince the Senate to exclude user-generated content from the bill, indicating a high likelihood of it becoming law. The potential impact on the internet andfree expression in Canada is significant, as the bill would give the government significant control over online content and restrict the ability of individuals to share their views and perspectives.
		- In a similar vein the forthcoming RESTRICT act in the USA gives hugepowers without oversight to a single branch of the US government.
			- The bill is called the “Restricting the Emergence of Security Threats that Risk Information and Communications Technology Act”
			- It was initially thought to be about banning TikTok due to its connections to the Chinese government and the data it collects on its users.
			- The RESTRICT Act has very little to do with banning TikTok and instead grants the US Secretary of Commerce significant powers to determine which entities are foreign adversaries and what technology poses a risk to national security.
			- The bill defines critical infrastructure broadly, which means it could apply to almost anything the government deems necessary. Lobbyists will be allowed to advise the Secretary of Commerce on which products and services should be labelled as foreign adversaries, potentially leading to monopolies.
			- Fines and jail time for interacting with foreign adversaries or posing a risk to national security could reach up to $1 million, 20 years in prison, and asset seizures.
			- The bill aims to crack down on VPNs (Virtual Private Networks), which provide privacy and access to foreign websites.
			- There is no oversight for the actions taken by the Secretary of Commerce under this act, and neither Congress nor the courts can request information on these decisions.
		- The European Union (EU) has separated its online censorship efforts into two separate bills: the Digital Markets Act and the Digital Services Act. These bills were introduced in December 2020 and are part of the EU’s Digital Services package, which aims to be completed by 2030. The Digital Services package is the second phase of the EU’s digital agenda, which is being enforced through regulation in the public sector and through ESG investing in the private sector. Both the Digital Markets Act and the Digital Services Act were passed in spring 2022 and went into force in autumn 2022, but will not be enforced until later this year and early next year, depending on the size of the relevant entity. The Digital Markets Act aims to increase the EU’s competitiveness in the tech space by imposing massive fines on "gatekeepers," or companies that maintain monopolies by giving preference to their own products and services. This could open the door to innovation in cryptocurrency in the EU, but also requires gatekeepers to provide detailed data about the individuals and institutions using their products and services to theE U. The Digital Services Act, on the other hand, aims to regulate the content that is available online, including user-generated content. It does this by requiring companies to remove illegal content within one hour of it being reported and by imposing fines for non-compliance. The act also requires companies to implement measures to protect users from illegal content and from "other forms of harm," which is defined broadly and could include a wide range of content. The EU is also in the process of passing the Artificial Intelligence Regulation Act, which will be discussed later this year and is reportedly the first of its kind. All five bills in the EU’s Digital Services package are regulations, meaning they will override the national laws of EU countries. The potential impact on the internet and free expression in the EU is significant, as the Digital Services Act would give the government significant control over online content and restrict the ability of individuals to share their views and perspectives.
		- In the United States, two significant documents related to online censorship are the Kids Online Safety Act and the Supreme Court caseGonzalez v. Google. The Kids Online Safety Act was introduced inFebruary 2021 and is expected to pass later this year due to bipartisan support. The act requires online services to collect Know Your Customer(KYC) information to ensure that they are not showing harmful content tominors. It also gives the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) the power to decide when children have been made unsafe online and allows parents tosue tech companies if their children have been harmed online. The act has received criticism from both sides of the political spectrum and entities outside of Congress, as it is seen as giving too much power tothe government to regulate online content and could lead to increased censorship by tech companies.
		- The Supreme Court case Gonzalez v. Google involves the question of whether Google’s algorithmic recommendations supported terrorism and contributed to the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris. The case has been picked up by the Supreme Court after being passed up by various courts of appeal. It is being heard alongside another case, Twitter v. Tumne, involving the role of Twitter’s algorithms in a terrorist attack in Istanbul. There are two potential outcomes for the case. If the Supreme Court sides with Gonzalez, it could increase the liability of social media companies under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which allows them to moderate content to a limited extent without violating the First Amendment. Alternatively, the Supreme Court could declare Section 230 unconstitutional, which would make online censorship illegal but also hinder the use of algorithms on the internet. The ideal outcome, in theory, would be for the Supreme Court to side with Google and for Congress to change Section 230. However, giving Congress the power to change the law could lead to increased censorship and the potential for abuse of power.
		- In the UK forthcoming legislation will see tech company leaders liablefor [prison sentences](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/bill-mps-iain-duncan-smith-molly-russell-rishi-sunak-b2263353.html) if they fail in their duty to protect minors. This will doubtless lead to both stringent universal requirements for identity proof (KYC), and significantly muted and controlled content on the platforms.
		- Our research focuses on business to business use cases for distributed technologies, and will provide mechanisms for verifying who is communicating with whom, to avoid falling foul of these swinging global infringements on privacy.
		- It is the opinion of this book that information should befree[[swartz2008guerilla]]

- ### Overview of Government Data Acquisition Practices
	- **Surveillance Capitalism**: This concept pertains to the commodification of personal data by private entities. The US government, among others, acquires this data for intelligence and enforcement purposes, circumventing traditional surveillance and legal protocols.
	- **Data Brokers' Role**: Data brokers are pivotal, operating businesses that amass and trade personal data without interacting directly with consumers. Their databases encompass a wide array, from social media behaviour to precise geolocation details.
	- #### THe TrUTh iS OuT ThERe

		- "Open source response"
			- CIA/MI5 Hacking Smart Devices
				- **Verdict:** Partly True. The CIA and MI5 have been known to engage in surveillance activities involving internet-connected devices through programmes like Weeping Angel. This program was designed to hack into Samsung smart TVs, but it's important to note that the extent of this capability and its current status are classified.
			- CIA Infecting Car Control Systems
				- **Verdict:** Partly True. Vault 7 revealed a range of hacking tools developed by the CIA, including those capable of exploiting vulnerabilities in modern car systems. However, there's no concrete evidence to suggest that the CIA has used these tools to remotely take control of cars.
			- Tech Companies Providing NSA with Zero-Day Vulnerabilities
				- **Verdict:** True. Documents leaked by Edward Snowden revealed that tech companies like Microsoft did provide advance warnings about zero-day vulnerabilities to the NSA before disclosing them to the public. This was part of a broader program aimed at improving national cybersecurity and giving government agencies an early warning system.
			- NSA Breaking Tor Networks
				- **Verdict:** Partly True. While the NSA has been involved in efforts to compromise Tor, there's no conclusive evidence that they have successfully broken the network or can identify users with certainty. However, it is known that various intelligence agencies have attempted to exploit vulnerabilities in Tor.
			- NSA Intercepts Devices and Installs Malware Chips
				- **Verdict:** Partly True. The ANT/TAO Catalogue, leaked by Edward Snowden in 2013, reveals the NSA's capabilities for intercepting and altering electronic devices, including installing malware or backdoors before they are delivered to customers. However, this catalogue primarily focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities in targeted surveillance operations rather than mass production of compromised devices.
			- American-Made Electronics Allow Access via Radio Frequencies
				- **Verdict:** Partly True. The Cottonmouth-I and SURLYSPAWN projects, as mentioned in the Snowden leaks, involve the use of radio frequency (RF) signals to remotely access devices. However, these were designed for specific targeted surveillance operations rather than mass surveillance. It's true that many modern electronic devices emit RF signals or can be accessed through their wireless capabilities, but this does not inherently mean that all American-made electronics are compromised for remote access by the NSA or FBI without further context.
			- Backdoored Random Number Generators
				- **Verdict:** Partly True. The Dual Elliptic Curve Deterministic Random Bit Generator (Dual EC DRBG) algorithm, developed by NIST and NSA, has been criticized for its potential to contain a backdoor that could allow the NSA to break RSA encryption.
			- NSA Backdoors in CPUs
				- **Verdict:** Partly True. The claim refers to Intel ME (Management Engine) and AMD PSP (Platform Security Processor), which are both hardware-based security features integrated into modern CPUs. While these technologies can operate independently of the main system, there's no conclusive evidence that they were implemented at the NSA's request or are being used by the NSA specifically for mass surveillance. Their primary purpose is enterprise-level management and security rather than clandestine operations.
			- FBI Distributes Undetectable Malware
				- **Verdict:** Partly True. The claim likely refers to the FBI's use of malware for law enforcement purposes, such as tracking suspects or gaining access to encrypted data. While the FBI has been known to use such tools, it's not accurate to say that anti-virus software is legally not allowed to detect them. However, some of these tools may be designed to evade detection by common anti-virus programmes.
			- Backdoored Random Number Generators
				- **Verdict:** Partly True. The Dual Elliptic Curve Deterministic Random Bit Generator (Dual EC DRBG) algorithm, developed by NIST and NSA, has been criticized for its potential to contain a backdoor that could allow the NSA to break RSA encryption. However, it's important to note that while the algorithm's vulnerabilities have been identified and it has been subsequently withdrawn from use, there's no conclusive evidence that the NSA actively exploited this backdoor to break RSA encryption on a widespread scale.
- ### Legal Framework, International Agreements, and Concerns
	- **Minimal Legal Barriers**: The acquisition of commercial data by governments faces scant legal opposition, attributed to the classification of such data as "publicly available." This status exempts it from the stringent privacy protections applicable to more confidential data.
	- **Privacy and Civil Liberties Issues**: The extensive gathering and utilisation of personal data by governmental entities elicit significant privacy alarms. Despite assurances of anonymisation, methods often exist to re-identify individuals, raising consent and privacy violation concerns.
	- **Data Sharing Agreements
		- Five Eyes Alliance**: International agreements like the Five Eyes (comprising Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States) facilitate extensive data sharing for intelligence purposes. This raises the stakes for data privacy, with personal data potentially shared across borders without explicit consent from individuals.
- ### The Influence of GDPR and the UK's Data Protection Framework
	- **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**: The GDPR represents a robust data protection initiative, offering EU citizens significant control over their personal data. It mandates explicit consent for data processing and grants individuals the right to access and request the deletion of their data. However, its effectiveness is occasionally undermined by complex consent forms and the global nature of data flows which transcend its jurisdiction.
	- **The UK Data Protection Act**: Post-Brexit, the UK continues to uphold strong data protection standards, mirroring GDPR principles. However, future divergences may impact international data sharing, especially concerning agreements with entities in jurisdictions with differing privacy standards.
- ### Technological Advancements and Their Dual-Edged Impact
	- **Rise of AI in Data Analysis**: AI's evolution has transformed data analysis, enabling the extraction of nuanced insights from vast datasets. This capability enhances government surveillance potential, making it more efficient but also raising ethical concerns.
	- **AI and Surveillance**: The misuse of AI for surveillance by state actors is a growing concern. AI can automate the monitoring of individuals on an unprecedented scale, necessitating stringent oversight.
	- **Data Encoded in AI Models**: Information about individuals becoming encoded in the latent spaces of foundational AI models poses unique challenges. This data embedding can inadvertently leak personal information, complicating efforts to protect individual privacy.
- ### Prospects for Reform and the Future Landscape
	- **Judicial and Legislative Responses**: Legal frameworks globally are under pressure to evolve in response to technological advancements. Judicial interventions may set new precedents, while legislative reforms, informed by GDPR and other standards, could offer more comprehensive protections.
	- **Impact of AI Regulation**: The regulation of AI technologies, to prevent their misuse for surveillance, becomes increasingly critical. Ensuring transparency and accountability in AI operations is paramount to safeguarding civil liberties.
	- **International Cooperation**: Addressing the global nature of data privacy requires international cooperation. Agreements on data protection standards and ethical AI use are essential to navigating the complex web of data surveillance, sharing, and protection.

	- Former NSA Director Michael Hayden said:
	- ```text
	  "we kill people based on metadata"
	  ```
	- during a debate in 2014 at John Hopkins University. Hayden admitted that the U.S. government uses metadata, which refers to data about communications like phone records (numbers called, time, duration) rather than the actual content, as a basis for killing people in drone strikes against terrorist suspects abroad. Reports based on Snowden leaks alleged the NSA used metadata analysis to track potential targets for lethal drone operations.
	- OpenAI [has appointed](https://openai.com/index/openai-announces-leadership-transition/) Retired U.S. Army General Paul M. Nakasone to its Board of Directors and the Board's Safety and Security Committee. General Nakasone is a leading expert in cybersecurity, having previously served as the Director of the National Security Agency (NSA) and Commander of U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM).
