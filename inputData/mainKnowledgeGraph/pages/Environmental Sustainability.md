## Environmental Sustainability

Environmental Sustainability refers to the responsible stewardship of natural resources and environmental systems in ai development and deployment, minimising ecological harm whilst potentially leveraging ai to address environmental challenges including climate change, biodiversity loss and resource depletion.

- Industry adoption reflects growing awareness of AI’s environmental footprint, with efforts to improve energy efficiency and integrate renewable energy sources in data centres.
  - Notable organisations include Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon, which are investing in carbon-negative goals and more efficient AI hardware.
  - UK examples: Manchester and Leeds host AI research centres focusing on sustainable AI applications; Newcastle and Sheffield contribute through smart city initiatives leveraging AI for environmental monitoring.
- Technical capabilities:
  - AI training and inference require substantial electricity and water, with data centres consuming billions of litres annually, raising concerns about resource depletion and local water scarcity.
  - Advances in hardware and grid decarbonisation offer pathways to reduce carbon and water footprints, but challenges remain in standardising measurement and reporting.
- Standards and frameworks:
  - There is a lack of unified methodologies for measuring AI’s environmental impact, with current assessments often carbon-centric and neglecting broader impacts like biodiversity and electronic waste.
  - International bodies such as ITU advocate for standardised, transparent metrics covering the full AI lifecycle.
