- # Insights about AI for small businesses
	- ## AI in the cloud vs your own AI
		- ### Business Admin leveraging Gemini
			- **Primary Recommendation: Google Gemini (Advanced Subscription)**
				- Integrates deeply with Google Workspace (Docs, Slides, Drive).
				- Provides cloud storage (2TB with subscription).
				- Offers powerful mobile app features (voice interaction, transcription, image recognition).
				- Suitable for general business tasks, writing, basic brainstorming, and initial concept generation.
				- Cost: ~$20/month (mentioned as 20 quid).
			- **Secondary/Specialized Tool: ChatGPT (Potentially Subscription)**
				- Currently superior for specific image manipulation tasks (e.g., placing objects accurately within an existing image, iterative image editing).
				- Consider subscribing if advanced, real-time image editing becomes a critical business need not met by Gemini.
			- **Local AI:** Mentioned briefly for transcription but quickly superseded by cloud recommendations for broader utility.
			- **Other Tools Mentioned:**
				- **Obsidian:** Powerful (free) note-taking and knowledge management app using markdown. Recommended for organising AI-generated ideas and notes long-term.
				- **Mermaid:** Diagram-as-code tool that AI (like Gemini) can generate output for (e.g., Gantt charts). Useful for structured visualization.
				- **Vectorworks:** existing design software. AI integration is currently limited by Vectorworks itself, but internal plugins might exist (like style transfer).
		- ### Core Concepts & Insights
			- **AI as a Productivity Multiplier:** AI can significantly speed up tasks like drafting text, generating ideas, creating initial visuals, and summarizing information.
			- **The "Jagged Frontier":** AI capabilities are inconsistent and change rapidly. Some tasks work well, others fail unexpectedly. Don't assume uniform competence.
			- **Hyper-Personalization:** AI enables tailoring outputs (designs, presentations, communication) specifically to individual client styles, preferences, and contexts (e.g., matching design visuals to a client's home art style). This is a key value proposition.
			- **Shift in Human Value:** As AI handles more tasks, human value shifts towards:
				- Personal relationships and trust.
				- Risk management and accountability (clients hire *you*, not the AI).
				- Expert oversight, curation, and refinement of AI outputs.
				- Understanding client needs deeply (the "why").
				- Creative direction and strategic thinking.
			- **Information Overload:** AI makes generating information easy, increasing the need for effective information management strategies.
			- **AI Doesn't Replace Expertise (Yet):** AI can generate plausible content but requires knowledgeable human oversight to cheque accuracy, relevance, and quality (e.g., checking plant suitability, design principles).
		- ### Practical Advice & Strategies
			- **Start with Gemini:** Focus initial efforts on learning and integrating Gemini due to its ecosystem integration and suitability for core business tasks.
			- **Embrace Experimentation:** Be prepared to try things, fail quickly, and iterate. Don't get discouraged if a prompt doesn't work; rephrase or try a different approach.
			- **Use Voice Interaction:** Leverage the Gemini mobile app's voice capabilities for note-taking, brainstorming, and information capture while on the go (walking, driving). Treat it like an advanced dictaphone that can also analyse and structure information.
			- **Develop Prompting Skills:**
				- Be specific with requests.
				- Provide context (e.g., target audience, desired style, constraints).
				- Define and reuse your own "style" (writing, design philosophy) as part of your prompts.
				- Iterate on prompts – refine them based on the output.
				- Don't be afraid to "smash lots of words" into the prompt; more (relevant) detail is often better.
			- **Leverage AI for Business Foundations:** Use AI immediately for tasks like:
				- Drafting business plans and marketing plans.
				- Market research and competitor analysis.
				- Generating ideas for lead generation.
				- Creating initial content for websites or social media.
				- Logo design concepts.
			- **Use AI for Design Assistance:**
				- Generate mood boards and concept visualizations quickly.
				- Create initial planting plans or Gantt charts (using Mermaid).
				- Generate stylized images based on sketches or concepts (potentially using ChatGPT for more control initially).
				- Explore AI for creating different visual perspectives or variations of a design idea.
			- **Integrate with Workflow:** Connect Gemini to Google Drive to allow it access to your documents for summarization, analysis, and writing tasks based on your data.
			- **Don't Over-Rely on Initial AI Output:** Treat AI output as a draught or starting point. Always review, edit, and refine based on your expertise. Don't read every word it generates initially; focus on the overall structure and key ideas.
			- **Prioritize Tasks:** Focus AI efforts on the most immediate business needs first (e.g., marketing, lead generation) before diving deep into more advanced applications (like complex image editing or video).
		- ### Learning & Development
			- **Expect a Learning Curve:** Allocate time (suggested 2-3 months) for dedicated exploration and practice to build confidence and proficiency.
			- **Play and Explore:** Regularly experiment with the tools ("fiddle around") to understand their capabilities and limitations. This is essential due to the rapid changes in AI.
			- **Focus on Confidence Building:** The initial phase is about getting comfortable talking to the AI, trying different prompts, and not being afraid of errors.
			- **Learn Markdown:** Useful for formatting AI outputs and using them in tools like Obsidian. Tell the AI to format responses in markdown.
			- **Stay Updated (Implicit):** The tools change constantly, requiring ongoing learning.
		- ### Business Applications (Garden Design Specific)
			- **Client Consultation Prep/Follow-up:** Transcribe and summarise meeting notes (using local AI on phone or Gemini).
			- **Concept Generation:** Quickly create mood boards, visual concepts, and planting ideas based on client needs and site photos.
			- **Visualization:** Generate stylized images of proposed designs, potentially matching the client's aesthetic (using their home/art as inspiration). Create different views (e.g., top-down plan from a perspective sketch).
			- **Planning & Scheduling:** Generate Gantt charts (via Mermaid) for project timelines.
			- **Plant Information:** Quickly look up plant details (Latin names, care requirements, soil pH) and generate care plans.
			- **Marketing Materials:** Draught website copy, social media posts, blog articles, marketing plans.
			- **Business Planning:** Assist in writing the business plan, analysing the market.
			- **Lead Generation:** Research potential clients (e.g., finding recent planning applications in specific areas - though agentic capabilities are future-facing, analysis of documents is possible).
			- **Logo/Branding Ideas:** Generate initial concepts for branding.
		- ### Information Management
			- **Challenge:** AI generates vast amounts of information quickly, making organization crucial.
			- **Strategy:** Develop a system to capture and retrieve valuable AI interactions and outputs.
			- **Tools:**
				- **Markdown:** Use as a standard format for notes.
				- **Obsidian:** Recommended for building a personal knowledge base, linking ideas, and storing notes long-term.
				- **Google Drive:** Use for storing documents and potentially allowing Gemini access.
			- **Process:** Be deliberate about saving useful AI conversations/outputs and potentially tagging or linking them for future reference (e.g., saving a good prompt, storing generated text in Obsidian).

	- Modern AI can transform 2D Vectorworks plans into client-ready visuals in five key formats.
	- ## Renderings from Plan Drawings
		- **Vectorworks AI Visualizer** ([FAQ](https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/articles.html/articles/faqs/ai-visualiser/))
			- Works inside Vectorworks 2024+, using your active file or view plus a text prompt.
			- Ideal for quick concept iterations (materials, lighting variations).
			- Note: not CAD-accurate rendering but excellent for inspirational visuals.
		- **Veras AI for Vectorworks** ([EvolveLAB announcement](https://www.evolvelab.io/post/announcing-veras-ai-for-vectorworks))
			- Plugin that uses your 3D model or 2D viewport as a base.
			- Photorealistic or stylised renders in seconds with prompt-driven material and ambience overrides.
		- **Mainstream Text-to-Image Generators**
			- Export plan or massing views as PNG/JPG and feed into Midjourney, Stable Diffusion (with ControlNet) or DALL·E 3 for high-res concept images.
			- Best for early-stage mood boards rather than precise layouts.
	- ## Walkthrough Animations or Flythrough Videos
		- **Twinmotion** ([guide](https://www.vectorworks.net/en-US/newsroom/your-guide-to-rendering-with-twinmotion))
			- Real-time link via Datasmith; create MP4 or interactive 360 panoramas.
			- Supports AI-powered denoising and crowd/traffic generation.

			- Live rendering inside Vectorworks, with keyframe-based video export and VR standalone packages.
		- **Experimental AI Video Tools**
			- Runway ML Gen-2 or PromeAI for short motion clips from still frames (low resolution but quick concept demos).
	- ## Stylised Artistic Illustrations
		- Use AI style-transfer plugins (such as Veras prompts for ‘watercolour sketch’ or ‘ink outline’)
		- Export views to image-to-image tools (Midjourney, Stable Diffusion with community style models) for watercolour, pencil or comic-book effects
		- Adobe Firefly in Photoshop for generative fill on SVG/PDF exports (text-to-image room textures, decorative elements)
	- ## Immersive AR and VR Experiences
		- **Vectorworks Nomad** ([app](https://apps.apple.com/ch/app/vectorworks-nomad/id506706850?l=en-GB))
			- Markerless AR viewer on iOS/Android; place your model at 1 : 1 scale on site without coding.
		- **Desktop VR via Enscape or Twinmotion**
			- One-click VR export to headsets (Oculus, Vive) for real-time walkthroughs.
		- **Custom Game-Engine Solutions**
			- Import via Datasmith into Unreal Engine or FBX/OBJ into Unity for bespoke interactive apps. AI can assist by auto-generating environment assets or textures.
		- **Web-Based AR/VR Viewers**
			- Upload glTF/GLB to platforms like Sketchfab for browser-based AR (USDZ for iOS Quick Look) or VR demos.
	- ## Converting 2D Plans into 3D Models
		- **usBIM.planAI** ([ACCA tool](https://www.accasoftware.com/en/2d-to-3d-how-to-convert-2d-files-into-3d-models))
			- Upload PNG, JPG or PDF plans; AI recognises walls, doors and rooms; outputs IFC for import into Vectorworks.
		- **Planner 5D AI** ([service](https://planner5d.com/ai))
			- Fast floor-plan recognition from images; yields a basic 3D layout you can reference or rebuild precisely.
		- **Coohom Floor Plan to 3D** ([overview](https://www.coohom.com/article/floor-plan-to-3d-ai))
			- One-click conversion with auto-furnished interiors; ideal for rapid prototyping and client approvals.
		- Other services (GetFloorPlan, RoomSketcher) offer similar AI-assisted conversions for sketches or scanned plans.
		-
- Start with a simple RAG setup in Logseq or Obsidian linked to your Vectorworks export folder so that every time you update a client plan, your AI system can index it.
- Use the AI Visualizer for rapid concept boards, then refine chosen options in Veras or Enscape for client review.
- Incorporate AR with Vectorworks Nomad on site visits—clients love seeing designs overlaid in real space.
- Keep stylistic consistency by choosing one illustration pipeline (for example, Stable Diffusion plus a ControlNet line-art workflow) and training a small set of prompts or custom LoRAs so that your presentations always look cohesive.
