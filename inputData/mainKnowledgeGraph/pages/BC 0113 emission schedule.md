## Academic Context

- Brief contextual overview
  - The BC 0113 emission schedule is a regulatory framework designed to standardise the reporting and management of vehicle emissions, particularly within the context of compliance and trading schemes.
  - It provides a structured approach for manufacturers and regulators to track, verify, and report emissions data, ensuring consistency and transparency in environmental reporting.

- Key developments and current state
  - The schedule has evolved to align with the latest UK and EU emissions standards, reflecting the increasing emphasis on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality.
  - It is now integrated into broader emissions trading and compliance frameworks, such as the Vehicle Emissions Trading Schemes (VETS) Order 2023 and its subsequent amendments.

- Academic foundations
  - The schedule is grounded in environmental science and regulatory economics, drawing on principles of emissions measurement, data management, and policy implementation.
  - It is supported by research from institutions such as the Air Quality Expert Group and the Committee on Climate Change.

## Current Landscape (2025)

- Industry adoption and implementations
  - The BC 0113 emission schedule is widely adopted by vehicle manufacturers, regulatory bodies, and environmental agencies across the UK.
  - Notable organisations and platforms include the Department for Transport, the Vehicle Certification Agency, and the Air Quality Expert Group.
  - UK and North England examples where relevant
    - In Manchester, the Greater Manchester Combined Authority has implemented the schedule in its local emissions monitoring and reporting systems.
    - Leeds City Council has integrated the schedule into its fleet management and procurement processes.
    - Newcastle City Council and Sheffield City Council have adopted the schedule for their public transport and municipal vehicle fleets.

- Technical capabilities and limitations
  - The schedule provides a robust framework for emissions data collection and reporting, but it requires regular updates to keep pace with technological advancements and regulatory changes.
  - Limitations include the need for accurate and consistent data input, as well as the potential for discrepancies in reporting methods across different regions and organisations.

- Standards and frameworks
  - The schedule is aligned with the Vehicle Emissions Trading Schemes (VETS) Order 2023 and its amendments, as well as the Climate Change Act 2008.
  - It also references the latest EU and UK emissions standards, such as the Euro 7 emissions standard, which took effect on 1st July 2025.

- Ongoing research directions
  - Research is focused on improving the accuracy and reliability of emissions data, developing more sophisticated data management systems, and exploring the integration of new technologies such as blockchain for secure and transparent emissions reporting.

## UK Context

- British contributions and implementations
  - The UK has been a leader in the development and implementation of emissions trading and compliance frameworks, with the BC 0113 emission schedule playing a key role in these efforts.
  - The schedule is supported by a network of regulatory bodies, research institutions, and industry stakeholders.

- North England innovation hubs (if relevant)
  - Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield are home to several innovation hubs and research centres focused on environmental science and sustainable transport.
  - These hubs are actively involved in the development and testing of new emissions monitoring and reporting technologies.

- Regional case studies
  - Greater Manchester Combined Authority has successfully implemented the BC 0113 emission schedule in its local emissions monitoring and reporting systems, leading to improved air quality and reduced emissions.
  - Leeds City Council has integrated the schedule into its fleet management and procurement processes, resulting in a more sustainable and environmentally friendly public transport system.

## Future Directions

- Emerging trends and developments
  - The integration of advanced data analytics and machine learning in emissions monitoring and reporting.
  - The development of more stringent emissions standards and the expansion of emissions trading schemes to cover a wider range of vehicle types and sectors.

- Anticipated challenges
  - Ensuring the accuracy and consistency of emissions data across different regions and organisations.
  - Addressing the potential for discrepancies in reporting methods and the need for regular updates to the schedule.

- Research priorities
  - Improving the accuracy and reliability of emissions data.
  - Developing more sophisticated data management systems.
  - Exploring the integration of new technologies for secure and transparent emissions reporting.
