## AI Board

AI Board refers to advisory body composed of representatives from eu member states, supported by the ai office, with the mission of coordinating uniform ai act implementation, issuing guidelines, and facilitating cooperation among national authorities.

- Industry adoption and implementations
	- The AI Board works closely with national competent authorities to ensure consistent enforcement of the AI Act
	- Notable organisations and platforms
		- The AI Office within the European Commission provides technical and administrative support to the Board
		- National authorities, such as the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), collaborate with the Board on compliance and enforcement
	- UK and North England examples where relevant
		- In North England, cities like Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield are emerging as hubs for AI innovation, with local authorities and universities engaging with the Board’s guidelines
		- For instance, the University of Manchester’s AI research centre has contributed to discussions on ethical AI deployment, reflecting the region’s growing influence in the field
- Technical capabilities and limitations
	- The Board facilitates the sharing of technical expertise and regulatory best practices among member states
	- Limitations include the challenge of harmonising diverse national approaches and ensuring timely updates to guidelines as AI technologies evolve
- Standards and frameworks
	- The Board plays a key role in developing and disseminating standards for AI governance, including guidelines for high-risk AI systems and general-purpose AI models
