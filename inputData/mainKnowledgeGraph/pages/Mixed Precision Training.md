## Mixed Precision Training

Mixed Precision Training refers to a training technique that uses lower precision (fp16) for most computations whilst maintaining higher precision (fp32) for critical operations, reducing memory usage and increasing training speed without sacrificing model quality. mixed precision training leverages modern gpu tensor cores for significant speedups.

- Mixed precision training is widely adopted across industry and research for accelerating neural network training while reducing memory consumption.
  - Major AI platforms and frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Amazon SageMaker provide built-in support for mixed precision, often with automatic loss scaling to maintain numerical stability.
  - Organisations running large-scale models leverage mixed precision to train models with hundreds of billions of parameters more efficiently.
  - In the UK, technology companies and research institutions increasingly integrate mixed precision training to optimise AI workloads.
    - For example, AI research groups in Manchester and Leeds employ mixed precision to accelerate computer vision and natural language processing projects.
    - Newcastle and Sheffield’s tech hubs also explore mixed precision to enable more cost-effective AI model development.
- Technical capabilities:
  - Mixed precision training reduces memory bandwidth and storage requirements by approximately half compared to full FP32 training.
  - It achieves up to 3x speedup on compatible GPUs with tensor cores.
  - Limitations include the need for hardware support and careful management of loss scaling to avoid accuracy degradation.
- Standards and frameworks:
  - The approach is standardised in major deep learning libraries with APIs for mixed precision.
  - Emerging support for even lower precisions such as FP8 is under exploration, promising further efficiency gains.
