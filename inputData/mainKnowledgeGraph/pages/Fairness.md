## Key Characteristics

### Types of Fairness

#### 1. Group Fairness (Statistical Parity)

**Demographic Parity**
- Equal positive prediction rates across groups
- $$P(\hat{Y}=1|A=0) = P(\hat{Y}=1|A=1)$$
- Where A is protected attribute (e.g., gender)

**Example**: Equal loan approval rates for men and women

**Equalized Odds**
- Equal true positive and false positive rates across groups
- $$P(\hat{Y}=1|Y=1,A=0) = P(\hat{Y}=1|Y=1,A=1)$$
- $$P(\hat{Y}=1|Y=0,A=0) = P(\hat{Y}=1|Y=0,A=1)$$

**Example**: Recidivism prediction equally accurate for all races

**Equal Opportunity**
- Equal true positive rates (recall) across groups
- $$P(\hat{Y}=1|Y=1,A=0) = P(\hat{Y}=1|Y=1,A=1)$$

**Example**: Qualified candidates equally likely to be hired regardless of gender

**Calibration**
- Predicted probabilities match actual outcomes across groups
- $$P(Y=1|\hat{Y}=p,A=0) = P(Y=1|\hat{Y}=p,A=1)$$

**Example**: 70% risk score means 70% probability for all groups

#### 2. Individual Fairness

**Similarity-Based Fairness**
- Similar individuals receive similar outcomes
- Dwork et al.: "Treat similar individuals similarly"
- Lipschitz condition: $$d(f(x_1), f(x_2)) \leq L \cdot d(x_1, x_2)$$

**Example**: Two applicants with same qualifications get similar loan terms

**Counterfactual Fairness**
- Decision unchanged if protected attribute were different
- Kusner et al.: Causal definition of fairness

**Example**: Loan decision same regardless of applicant's race

#### 3. Procedural Fairness

- Transparency in decision-making process
- Ability to contest decisions
- Right to explanation
- Human oversight and appeal mechanisms

#### 4. Distributive Fairness

- Equitable distribution of benefits and burdens
- Consideration of existing inequalities
- Justice in outcomes

## Fairness Metrics

### Classification Metrics

1. **Demographic Parity Difference (DPD)**
   ```
   DPD = |P(Ŷ=1|A=0) - P(Ŷ=1|A=1)|
   ```
   - Range: [0, 1]
   - Threshold: Often < 0.1 for "fairness"

2. **Disparate Impact (DI)**
   ```
   DI = P(Ŷ=1|A=0) / P(Ŷ=1|A=1)
   ```
   - Range: [0, ∞]
   - 80% rule: DI ≥ 0.8 (EEOC guideline)

3. **Equalized Odds Difference (EOD)**
   ```
   EOD = |TPR₀ - TPR₁| + |FPR₀ - FPR₁|
   ```

4. **Average Odds Difference (AOD)**
   ```
   AOD = (|TPR₀ - TPR₁| + |FPR₀ - FPR₁|) / 2
   ```

### Ranking Metrics

1. **Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) Parity**

## 2024-2025: From Theory to Regulatory Mandate
id:: fairness-recent-developments

The period from 2024 to 2025 represented a pivotal transition whereby algorithmic fairness evolved from an academic and voluntary concern into a **legally mandated requirement** across multiple jurisdictions, whilst simultaneously revealing the profound practical challenges of implementing fairness metrics in production AI systems at scale.

### Regulatory Codification of Fairness

The **EU AI Act**, which entered into force on 1st August 2024, established the world's first comprehensive legal framework explicitly requiring fairness in high-risk AI systems. **Article 10** mandates that training datasets for high-risk systems must be "free from errors and complete" and subject to "appropriate data governance and management practices." Crucially, **Recital 44** identifies fairness as a "core requirement" for high-risk AI, with system providers facing penalties up to **€35 million or 7% of worldwide annual turnover** for non-compliance.

The **Colorado AI Act**, enacted on 17th May 2024 and effective February 2026, became the first U.S. state law mandating fairness assessments for "high-risk" automated decision systems in employment, education, financial services, healthcare, housing, and legal contexts. The Act requires **algorithmic discrimination impact assessments** and affords consumers the right to opt out of profiling for consequential decisions.

**New York City's Local Law 144**, which took effect in July 2023 but saw active enforcement intensify throughout 2024, requires annual **bias audits** of automated employment decision tools, with results publicly disclosed, making NYC the first U.S. jurisdiction to mandate fairness auditing with transparency requirements.

### Fairness-Accuracy Trade-offs in Practice

Whilst fairness metrics have been well-theorised, 2024-2025 revealed the stark **operational challenges** of implementing fairness constraints in production systems. Research demonstrated that achieving demographic parity or equalised odds often requires **significant accuracy degradation**, particularly for minority groups the fairness constraints aim to protect.

A significant debate emerged around **fairness gerrymandering**: organisations selecting specific fairness metrics that produce favourable scores whilst ignoring metrics that would reveal bias. For instance, a hiring algorithm might satisfy demographic parity (equal hiring rates across groups) whilst violating equalised odds (unequal accuracy across groups), and organisations might publicly report only the favourable metric.

The **impossibility theorems** established by Chouldechova (2017) and Kleinberg et al. (2017) moved from theoretical curiosities to practical dilemmas. Organisations discovered they could not simultaneously satisfy calibration, balance for positive class, and balance for negative class except in trivial cases, forcing explicit **value judgements** about which fairness definition to prioritise.

### ISO Fairness Standards Adoption

**ISO/IEC 42001:2023**, published in December 2023, gained widespread adoption throughout 2024 as the first international standard for AI management systems, with fairness and non-discrimination as core requirements. **ISO/IEC TR 24027:2021**, focusing specifically on bias in AI systems, became the de facto reference for fairness metric selection and bias mitigation strategies.

Many organisations pursuing ISO 42001 certification discovered that achieving **demonstrable fairness** required substantial architectural changes, not merely post-processing adjustments. This drove adoption of **fairness-aware machine learning** techniques during model training rather than relying solely on threshold adjustments after training.

### Intersectional Fairness and Compounding Bias

2024 witnessed increased focus on **intersectional fairness**—examining AI system performance across intersections of multiple protected attributes (e.g., Black women, elderly disabled persons). Research consistently demonstrated that examining single attributes in isolation masked substantial disparities at intersections.

Fairness tools such as **AI Fairness 360**, **Fairlearn**, and **Aequitas** added intersectional analysis capabilities, allowing practitioners to compute fairness metrics across multiple demographic intersections simultaneously. However, intersectional analysis exacerbated the **small sample problem**: many intersectional subgroups had insufficient data for statistically meaningful fairness assessment, creating a tension between comprehensiveness and statistical validity.

### Contextual and Cultural Fairness

The global deployment of AI systems in 2024-2025 highlighted that fairness is **culturally contextual**. What constitutes "fair" treatment varies across societies, legal traditions, and cultural values. For instance, demographic parity is legally required in some EU contexts, whilst U.S. law emphasises individual merit and may reject group-based fairness metrics as discriminatory.

This created challenges for multinational AI systems: a single model deployed globally might satisfy fairness requirements in one jurisdiction whilst violating them in another. Some organisations developed **region-specific models** with different fairness constraints, whilst others sought "universal" fairness criteria that satisfied multiple jurisdictions simultaneously (often at the cost of reduced accuracy).

### Automated Fairness Monitoring

By late 2024, **continuous fairness monitoring** became a standard practice for high-risk AI systems. Rather than one-time fairness audits, organisations implemented real-time dashboards tracking fairness metrics in production, with automated alerts when metrics degraded below thresholds.

This shift was driven by recognition that fairness is not static: models degrade over time due to **distribution shift**, **feedback loops**, and **changing demographics**. What was fair at deployment may become unfair months later without ongoing vigilance.

### The Fairness Washing Problem

Regulators and civil society organisations raised concerns about **fairness washing**—superficial claims of fairness without substantive evidence. In response, the EU AI Act's **Article 13** requires **technical documentation** demonstrating how fairness was achieved, whilst NYC's bias audit law requires specific methodological disclosure.

Academic research in 2025 proposed **fairness certification schemes** analogous to security certifications, with independent third parties verifying fairness claims against standardised criteria, though widespread adoption remained nascent.
