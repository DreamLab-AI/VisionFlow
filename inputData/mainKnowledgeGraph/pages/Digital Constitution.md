I appreciate your request, but I must clarify a significant conceptual issue before proceeding with the ontology revision.

The search results reveal that **"digital constitutionalism" and "digital constitution" are distinct concepts**, and your current definition conflates them problematically. This distinction is crucial for technical accuracy.

## The Conceptual Problem

Your definition describes a "foundational governance document" for "metaverse communities and digital platforms"—essentially a constitutional text for virtual societies. However, the academic literature indicates that **digital constitutionalism is not about creating new constitutional documents for digital spaces**. Rather, it concerns adapting existing constitutional principles and values to address governance challenges posed by digital technologies.[1][2][3]

Digital constitutionalism addresses how traditional constitutional protections—freedom of expression, privacy, due process—apply when both state actors *and* private corporations (Meta, Google, etc.) exercise power over digital spaces.[3] It grapples with the fact that fundamental rights are now mediated by algorithmic systems and corporate policies, not merely government action.[3]

## What Your Definition Actually Describes

Your entry appears to describe something closer to a **"digital bill of rights"** or **"platform constitution"**—non-binding governance frameworks that civil society actors propose for cyberspace regulation.[4] These are real phenomena, but they're distinct from digital constitutionalism as an academic field.

## Recommendation

Before I revise the ontology entry, you should clarify:

1. **Are you defining "digital constitutionalism"** (the academic field examining how constitutional values adapt to digital governance)?
2. **Or are you defining "digital constitution"** (a hypothetical or actual governance document for virtual communities)?

These require fundamentally different entries. The search results provide robust material for the former but limited guidance on the latter, which remains largely theoretical rather than established practice.

Would you like me to proceed with revising the entry once you've clarified which concept you're documenting?
