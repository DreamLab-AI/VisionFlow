## Object Detection and Tracking

Object Detection and Tracking refers to object detection and tracking combines spatial object localisation with temporal tracking to identify, classify, and follow objects across video frames or sensor streams. this capability is essential for autonomous systems to understand dynamic environments, predict object motion, and make safe navigation decisions. modern systems employ deep learning detectors (yolo, faster r-cnn) combined with tracking algorithms (kalman filters, sort, deepsort).

- Industry adoption and implementations
  - Widely deployed in autonomous vehicles, surveillance, robotics, and industrial automation
  - Leading platforms include Datature, Encord, and Roboflow, supporting both open-source and proprietary tracking pipelines
  - UK organisations such as Oxbotica (Oxford), FiveAI (London), and Wayve (Cambridge) are integrating advanced detection and tracking for autonomous mobility
- Notable organisations and platforms
  - Roboflow: Open-source tracking tools and datasets
  - Encord: Annotation and tracking software for enterprise applications
  - Datature: End-to-end computer vision workflows
- UK and North England examples where relevant
  - Manchester’s AI City initiative leverages object detection for smart city surveillance and traffic management
  - Leeds-based companies are applying tracking in retail analytics and crowd monitoring
  - Newcastle and Sheffield universities collaborate with local industry on robotics and autonomous systems, using detection and tracking for navigation and safety
- Technical capabilities and limitations
  - State-of-the-art models achieve high accuracy and real-time performance, but challenges remain with occlusion, rapid motion, and scale variation
  - Modular architectures (tracking-by-detection) allow flexibility, while integrated approaches (detection-by-tracking) offer superior performance at the cost of complexity
- Standards and frameworks
  - Common benchmarks include MOTChallenge, BDD100K, and COCO
  - Open-source frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Detectron2 are widely used for research and deployment
