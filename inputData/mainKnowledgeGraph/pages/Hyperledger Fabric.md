## Hyperledger Fabric

Hyperledger Fabric refers to a component of the blockchain ecosystem.

- Industry adoption and implementations
  - Fabric is widely used in sectors such as finance, supply chain, healthcare, and government
  - Notable organisations and platforms include IBM Blockchain, R3 Corda, and various consortia focused on industry-specific use cases
  - In the UK, Fabric has been adopted by financial institutions, logistics companies, and public sector bodies
- UK and North England examples where relevant
  - In Manchester, Fabric has been used in supply chain projects to enhance transparency and traceability
  - Leeds-based fintechs have leveraged Fabric for secure and efficient cross-border payments
  - Newcastle and Sheffield have seen pilot projects in healthcare and public services, focusing on data sharing and privacy
- Technical capabilities and limitations
  - Fabric offers high transaction throughput, low latency, and robust privacy controls
  - Its modular architecture allows for customisation and integration with existing systems
  - Limitations include complexity in setup and management, and the need for skilled developers
- Standards and frameworks
  - Fabric adheres to industry standards for blockchain interoperability and security
  - It is part of the broader Hyperledger ecosystem, which includes other frameworks and tools
