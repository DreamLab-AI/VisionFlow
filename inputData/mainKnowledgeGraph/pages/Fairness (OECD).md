## Fairness (OECD)

Fairness (OECD) refers to ai systems should not create or reinforce unfair bias, discrimination or disparate impacts on individuals or groups based on protected characteristics, and should incorporate appropriate safeguards to ensure equitable treatment and opportunity whilst respecting legitimate differentiation based on actual relevant differences.

- Industry adoption of OECD fairness principles is widespread among governments and private sector actors, influencing regulatory frameworks such as the EU AI Act and the NIST AI Risk Management Framework.
  - Notable organisations implementing these principles include multinational tech firms, regulatory bodies, and AI ethics boards.
  - In the UK, public and private sectors increasingly integrate fairness safeguards in AI deployment, with particular attention to compliance with UK equality law and data protection standards.
  - North England cities like Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield host AI innovation hubs and research centres actively exploring fairness in AI applications, especially in healthcare, public services, and finance.
- Technical capabilities to detect and mitigate bias have improved but remain limited by data quality, representativeness, and evolving societal norms.
- The OECD framework remains non-binding but influential, promoting harmonisation and interoperability across jurisdictions without imposing sector-specific mandates.

- Ongoing research focuses on:
  - Developing context-sensitive fairness metrics that reflect UK and European socio-legal norms.
  - Enhancing transparency and human oversight mechanisms.
  - Addressing intersectional biases and systemic inequalities amplified by AI.

## UK Context

- The UK government and regulatory bodies, including the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), actively promote fairness in AI through guidance aligned with OECD principles.
- North England innovation hubs:
  - Manchester’s AI and Data Science Institute explores fairness in public health AI tools.
  - Leeds Digital Hub supports ethical AI startups focusing on equitable financial services.
  - Newcastle University’s Centre for AI and Data Governance researches bias mitigation techniques.
  - Sheffield’s Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre integrates fairness considerations in AI-driven industrial automation.
- Regional case studies highlight challenges in balancing fairness with operational efficiency, especially in public sector AI deployments affecting diverse populations.

## Future Directions

- Emerging trends include:
  - Integration of generative AI fairness safeguards, reflecting OECD updates addressing evolving AI capabilities.
  - Development of dynamic fairness frameworks that adapt to AI systems’ post-deployment learning.
  - Greater emphasis on environmental and social sustainability as part of fairness considerations.
- Anticipated challenges:
  - Harmonising fairness standards across jurisdictions with differing legal and cultural contexts.
  - Managing trade-offs between fairness, privacy, and transparency.
  - Ensuring meaningful human oversight without stifling innovation.
- Research priorities:
  - Refining fairness definitions to incorporate UK-specific protected characteristics and social realities.
  - Creating robust auditing tools that are accessible to smaller organisations and public bodies.
  - Investigating the impact of AI fairness interventions on long-term social equity.
