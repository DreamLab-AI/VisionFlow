## AI Risk Register

AI Risk Register refers to ai risk register is a structured repository that systematically documents, tracks, and manages identified risks associated with ai systems throughout their lifecycle, recording risk descriptions, severity assessments, likelihood evaluations, assigned ownership, mitigation strategies, and current status to support risk governance and decision-making. this register captures diverse risk categories including technical risks (model performance failures, robustness issues, adversarial vulnerabilities), ethical risks (fairness violations, discrimination, bias amplification), legal and compliance risks (regulatory violations, liability exposure, contractual breaches), operational risks (system availability, integration failures, resource constraints), security and privacy risks (data breaches, privacy violations, adversarial attacks), reputational risks (public backlash, stakeholder concerns, brand damage), and societal risks (unintended consequences, systemic impacts, dual-use concerns). each risk entry typically documents risk identifier and title, detailed description of the risk scenario, affected systems and stakeholders, likelihood rating (rare, unlikely, possible, likely, almost certain), consequence or severity rating (insignificant, minor, moderate, major, catastrophic), overall risk level (likelihood × consequence), assigned risk owner responsible for mitigation, current mitigation measures and controls, residual risk after mitigation, risk status (open, in-progress, mitigated, accepted), review dates and audit trail. the register supports risk governance by enabling risk-based decision-making, prioritization of mitigation efforts, compliance demonstration, trend analysis, and continuous monitoring. implementation aligns with enterprise risk management frameworks (iso 31000), ai-specific risk standards (iso/iec 23894:2023 ai risk management), and regulatory requirements including eu ai act article 9 risk management systems and financial services operational risk frameworks.

- Industry adoption and implementations
	- Leading organisations across sectors—including finance, healthcare, and public services—now routinely maintain AI risk registers as part of their compliance and governance infrastructure
	- Platforms such as LayerX Security, Superblocks, and TrustCloud offer specialised tools for building and maintaining AI risk registers, often with integrations for model monitoring and audit trails
- Notable organisations and platforms
	- UK-based firms like BenevolentAI (London) and Faculty (Cambridge) have published case studies on their use of AI risk registers for model governance
	- In North England, organisations such as the Greater Manchester Combined Authority and Leeds City Council have piloted AI risk registers for public sector AI deployments, focusing on transparency and accountability
- Technical capabilities and limitations
	- Modern AI risk registers support granular tracking of risks by category (e.g., bias, security, regulatory), system, and data sensitivity
	- Limitations include the challenge of quantifying intangible risks (e.g., reputational damage) and the need for ongoing human oversight to ensure accuracy and relevance
- Standards and frameworks
	- The NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF) and ISO/IEC 42001 provide structured approaches to AI risk management, with the AI RMF Generative AI Profile (NIST-AI-600-1) offering specific guidance for generative AI systems
	- The EU AI Act has influenced UK regulatory expectations, particularly for high-risk AI systems

- Ongoing research directions
	- Research is increasingly focused on automating risk identification and mitigation through AI-powered risk registers
	- There is growing interest in the role of human-in-the-loop controls and the integration of risk registers with model registries for end-to-end AI governance

## UK Context

- British contributions and implementations
	- The UK has been at the forefront of developing practical AI risk management tools, with organisations such as the Alan Turing Institute and the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation publishing guidance on AI risk registers
	- The UK government’s AI Regulation White Paper (2023) emphasises the importance of risk-based approaches to AI governance, with risk registers playing a central role
- North England innovation hubs
	- Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield have emerged as regional hubs for AI innovation, with local universities and public sector bodies collaborating on AI risk management initiatives
	- For example, the University of Manchester’s AI for Social Good programme has developed a risk register template tailored for public sector AI deployments
- Regional case studies
	- The Greater Manchester AI Alliance has published a case study on the use of AI risk registers for smart city projects, highlighting the importance of stakeholder engagement and transparency
	- Leeds City Council’s AI risk register for social care applications has been cited as a model for local government AI governance

## Future Directions

- Emerging trends and developments
	- The integration of AI risk registers with real-time monitoring and alerting systems is expected to become standard practice
	- There is a growing trend towards the use of AI-powered risk registers that can automatically identify and escalate risks based on model behaviour and data patterns
- Anticipated challenges
	- Ensuring the scalability and interoperability of AI risk registers across different organisational contexts and regulatory regimes
	- Addressing the ethical and legal implications of automated risk identification and mitigation
- Research priorities
	- Developing robust metrics for quantifying AI risk and evaluating the effectiveness of mitigation controls
	- Exploring the role of AI risk registers in fostering public trust and accountability in AI systems
