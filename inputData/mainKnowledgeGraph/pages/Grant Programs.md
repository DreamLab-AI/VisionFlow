## Grant Programs

Grant Programs refers to a component of the blockchain ecosystem.

- Grant programmes are widely adopted across blockchain platforms, foundations, and decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs), providing equity-free funding to startups, researchers, and developers.
  - Notable organisations include the Ethereum Foundation, Chainlink, Avalanche, Stellar Development Foundation, Solana Foundation, and the Web3 Foundation.
  - These grants support a spectrum of activities: from tooling and infrastructure development, security audits, and oracle services to social impact projects and academic research.
- UK and North England examples:
  - Manchester and Leeds have emerging blockchain hubs where local startups actively seek and benefit from such grants.
  - Newcastle and Sheffield universities participate in blockchain research funded by academic grants, often collaborating with industry partners.
- Technical capabilities:
  - Grants often target projects that enhance scalability, interoperability, security, and usability of blockchain networks.
  - Limitations include the competitive nature of grant awards and the need for clear, demonstrable impact.
- Standards and frameworks:
  - Many grant programmes require adherence to open-source licencing and encourage publication of results under permissive licences.
  - Selection criteria typically include innovation potential, technical feasibility, and alignment with ecosystem goals.
