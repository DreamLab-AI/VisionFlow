## Cold Chain Monitoring

Cold Chain Monitoring refers to a component of the blockchain ecosystem.

- Industry adoption of cold chain monitoring has expanded significantly, driven by increasing demand for perishable goods, pharmaceuticals, and biologics requiring strict temperature control.
  - Notable platforms integrate IoT sensors, blockchain for secure and transparent data logging, and cloud-based analytics to provide real-time visibility and compliance tracking.
  - UK companies and logistics providers increasingly deploy these technologies, with particular uptake in North England’s logistics hubs such as Manchester and Leeds.
- Technical capabilities now include:
  - Real-time temperature and location tracking via IoT sensors and GPS.
  - Immutable, auditable records through blockchain technology.
  - Automated alerts and smart contracts for compliance enforcement.
  - AI-enhanced predictive maintenance and route optimisation.
- Limitations remain around internet connectivity dependency, data interoperability challenges, and subscription costs for cloud services.
- Standards and frameworks are evolving, with regulatory bodies like the UK’s MHRA and international organisations (IATA, WHO) emphasising real-time monitoring and data integrity.
