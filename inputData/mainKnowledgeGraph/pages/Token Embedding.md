## Token Embedding

Token Embedding refers to a learnable lookup table that maps each token in the vocabulary to a dense vector representation, providing the initial semantic encoding for transformer models.

- Token embeddings remain central to transformer-based models, which dominate state-of-the-art natural language understanding and generation tasks.
  - Modern embeddings are often contextual, dynamically adjusting based on surrounding tokens via self-attention mechanisms.
  - Instruction-tuned embedding models have emerged, optimising embeddings for specific tasks such as semantic search or document ranking, reflecting a shift from generic to purpose-driven embeddings.
  - Some recent research challenges the traditional view of embeddings as semantic containers, suggesting that high-level semantics emerge from the transformer's architecture and training data rather than the embeddings themselves.
- Industry adoption is widespread across cloud platforms, AI startups, and research institutions.
  - Leading models include BERT, GPT-4, LLaMA, and Mistral, all utilising advanced embedding techniques.
- Technical capabilities:
  - Embeddings efficiently encode semantic and syntactic information but can be limited by vocabulary size and out-of-vocabulary tokens.
  - Weight tying between embedding and un-embedding layers reduces parameter count and improves training stability.
- Standards and frameworks:
  - Embedding layers are standard components in transformer libraries such as Hugging Face Transformers and TensorFlow.
  - Tokenisation and embedding strategies continue to evolve, with Unicode-centric tokenisers gaining attention for universal text coverage.

  - This paper demonstrates that transformer models can achieve strong semantic performance even with frozen, non-trainable embeddings derived from Unicode visual structure, suggesting semantics emerge from model architecture rather than embeddings alone.
