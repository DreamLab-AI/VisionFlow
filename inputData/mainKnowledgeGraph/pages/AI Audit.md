  - **Definition**
    - definition:: AI Audit refers to a systematic, independent, and documented examination and evaluation process of an artificial intelligence system's complete lifecycle including design decisions, development methodologies, training data and processes, deployment procedures, operational performance, governance structures, and compliance with applicable technical, ethical, legal, and regulatory requirements, conducted by qualified internal or third-party assessors possessing expertise spanning AI technology, ethics, law, and domain-specific knowledge to verify conformity with specified standards, identify deficiencies or risks, and produce evidence-based findings and recommendations supporting accountability, transparency, and continuous improvement of AI system trustworthiness. This comprehensive assessment evaluates technical performance metrics including accuracy, robustness, and reliability, ethical considerations encompassing fairness, bias detection, and discrimination prevention, legal compliance with data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA), AI-specific frameworks (EU AI Act Article 43), and industry standards (ISO/IEC 42001:2023), security posture against adversarial attacks and data breaches, transparency and explainability enabling stakeholder understanding of AI decision-making, and governance adequacy including roles, responsibilities, oversight mechanisms, and accountability structures. The audit methodology follows structured processes: scoping and planning (defining audit objectives, scope, and criteria), documentation review (examining technical specifications, training procedures, risk assessments, model cards, and governance policies), technical testing (validation testing, fairness analysis, robustness evaluation, security assessments), stakeholder interviews with developers, operators, and affected parties, impact assessment analyzing real-world outcomes and consequences, findings documentation with evidence-based conclusions, and recommendations for remediation and improvement. Audit types include pre-deployment audits verifying readiness, periodic operational audits monitoring ongoing performance, incident-triggered audits following failures, and regulatory compliance audits mandated by frameworks including BS ISO/IEC 42006:2025 establishing requirements for AI audit body certification and competencies.

## AI Audit

AI Audit refers to a systematic, independent examination and evaluation of an artificial intelligence system's design, development processes, deployment procedures, operational performance, documentation, governance arrangements, and compliance with applicable requirements, conducted by qualified assessors to verify conformity with specified standards, regulations, ethical principles, or organisational policies, and to identify deficiencies, risks, or opportunities for improvement, producing documented findings and recommendations that support accountability, transparency, and continuous enhancement of ai system trustworthiness.

- Industry adoption and implementations
	- AI auditing is now a mainstream practice, with leading organisations across sectors implementing regular audits to ensure compliance, manage risk, and build stakeholder trust
	- Notable organisations and platforms
		- KPMG, PwC, Deloitte, and EY have all launched dedicated AI auditing services, reflecting the growing market demand for transparency and accountability
		- Specialist platforms such as LumenAlta and DSALTA offer AI-powered audit tools and frameworks, enabling organisations to automate and scale their compliance activities
- UK and North England examples where relevant
	- In Manchester, the Digital Catapult has established an AI audit lab, supporting local businesses in developing robust governance practices
	- Leeds City Council has implemented an AI audit framework for its smart city initiatives, ensuring that automated decision-making systems are transparent and fair
	- Newcastle University’s Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation has partnered with local authorities to pilot AI audits in public services, focusing on ethical and social impact
- Technical capabilities and limitations
	- Modern AI auditing tools can process large datasets, identify compliance gaps, and generate comprehensive audit reports in near real-time
	- However, challenges remain in auditing complex, black-box models and ensuring that audit findings are actionable and understandable to non-technical stakeholders
- Standards and frameworks
	- The publication of BS ISO/IEC 42006:2025 by BSI has set a new benchmark for the certification of AI audit bodies, ensuring that auditors have standardised competencies and methodologies
	- The EU AI Act and NIST AI Risk Management Framework provide additional guidance on risk assessment and compliance, with a focus on transparency and accountability
