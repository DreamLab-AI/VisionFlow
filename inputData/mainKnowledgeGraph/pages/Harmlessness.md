## Key Characteristics

- Avoids harmful outputs
- Core alignment objective
- Balances with helpfulness
- Defined through principles or examples
- Assessed through evaluation
- Critical for deployment

## Usage in AI/ML

"Constitutional AI achieves harmlessness through self-improvement guided by principles."
