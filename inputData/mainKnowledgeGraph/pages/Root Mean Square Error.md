### Relationships
- is-subclass-of:: [[PerformanceMetric]]
	- definition:: A regression performance metric representing the square root of the average squared differences between predicted and actual values, calculated by taking the mean of squared prediction errors and then applying the square root, providing a measure of prediction accuracy in the same units as the target variable whilst giving disproportionate weight to larger errors, making it particularly sensitive to outliers and appropriate when large prediction errors are significantly more problematic than small errors.

## Academic Context

- Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is a fundamental regression performance metric quantifying the average magnitude of prediction errors by calculating the square root of the mean of squared differences between predicted and observed values[1][2]
  - Mathematically equivalent to the standard deviation of residuals, representing how tightly data points cluster around the regression line[2][5]
  - Retains the same units as the target variable, facilitating intuitive interpretation of prediction accuracy[3][4]
  - The metric disproportionately penalises larger errors due to squaring, making it sensitive to outliers and particularly useful when large deviations are more problematic than small ones[1][3][5]
- RMSE is widely used across statistics, machine learning, econometrics, climatology, and forecasting, serving as a non-standardised goodness-of-fit measure complementary to metrics like R-squared[2]
  - The academic foundation lies in least squares estimation and error analysis, with properties well-established in statistical theory and practice[5]
  - Calculation process: compute residuals for each data point, square them, calculate the mean of squared residuals, then take the square root[1][3]

## Current Landscape (2025)

- Industry adoption and implementations
  - RMSE remains a standard metric for evaluating regression and predictive models in both academic research and industry applications[1][2]
  - Widely implemented in automated machine learning platforms for hyperparameter optimisation and model selection[1]
  - Used extensively in supervised learning applications where true measurements are available at each predicted data point[1]
- Technical capabilities and limitations
  - Provides a single numerical measure useful during training, cross-validation, and post-deployment monitoring[1]
  - Scale-dependent metric, meaning comparisons between models are affected by data scale; typically applied to standardised data for fair model comparison[1][5]
  - Sensitivity to outliers can be problematic in datasets with unusual poor predictions; Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or median-based approaches may provide better representation of typical model performance[1][3]
  - Most effective when used alongside complementary metrics rather than in isolation[3]
- Standards and frameworks
  - Recognised as a proper scoring rule compatible with common statistical assumptions[1]
  - Increasingly integrated into machine learning pipelines and automated model evaluation frameworks[1]
