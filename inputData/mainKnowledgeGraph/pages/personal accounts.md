## When to Report UK Bitcoin Sales for Tax as an Individual

If you sold Bitcoin in the UK in **May 2025**, here is what you need to know about tax reporting:
- ## Tax Year and Reporting Period
- The UK tax year runs from **6 April 2024 to 5 April 2025**.
- As your sale occurred in May 2025, this falls in the **2025–2026 tax year** (6 April 2025 to 5 April 2026)[](https://koinly.io/guides/hmrc-cryptocurrency-tax-guide/).
- ## Reporting Deadline
- If you file your self-assessment **online**, you must report your crypto gains (and pay any tax due) by **31 January 2027**[](https://www.blockpit.io/tax-guides/crypto-tax-united-kingdom-hmrc)[](https://www.kraken.com/learn/uk-crypto-tax-guide)[](https://koinly.io/guides/hmrc-cryptocurrency-tax-guide/)[](https://www.ross-brooke.co.uk/what-we-do/capital-gains-tax/capital-gains-tax-reporting-residential-sales/).
- If you file with a **paper return**, the deadline is **31 October 2026**[](https://www.blockpit.io/tax-guides/crypto-tax-united-kingdom-hmrc)[](https://www.kraken.com/learn/uk-crypto-tax-guide)[](https://koinly.io/guides/hmrc-cryptocurrency-tax-guide/).
- Most individuals file online.
- ## Which Gains to Report
- You must report all taxable gains for the 2025–2026 tax year, including those from Bitcoin sales, using the **Self Assessment tax return**.
- If your total capital gains for the tax year exceed the Annual Exempt Amount (£3,000 for 2025–26), tax will be owed; even if below, you may still need to report if your proceeds are high or you are already in Self Assessment[](https://www.blockpit.io/tax-guides/crypto-tax-united-kingdom-hmrc)[](https://koinly.io/guides/hmrc-cryptocurrency-tax-guide/).
- ## How to Report
- Register for Self Assessment (if not already registered).
- Complete the Capital Gains Summary section, including your Bitcoin transaction(s).
- Submit digitally by the deadline and pay tax owed by the same date[](https://www.blockpit.io/tax-guides/crypto-tax-united-kingdom-hmrc)[](https://www.kraken.com/learn/uk-crypto-tax-guide)[](https://koinly.io/guides/hmrc-cryptocurrency-tax-guide/).
