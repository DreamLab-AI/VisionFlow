- ## Cashu: Privacy-Preserving Bitcoin Ecash Protocol
	- Cashu is a free and open-source **Chaumian ecash protocol built for Bitcoin** enabling instant, nearly-free, and completely anonymous bearer token transactions. The protocol leverages [[Blind Signatures]] to preserve user privacy while maintaining transaction validity through decentralized [[Mints]].
	- **Current Status (2025)**: Actively developed with production-ready implementations in Python ([[nutshell]]), TypeScript ([[cashu-ts]]), and Rust ([[CDK]]). Multiple wallet platforms deployed across iOS, Android, and web, including eNuts mobile wallet and cashu.me progressive web application.
	- **Privacy Claim**: Mint operators and third-party observers cannot link individual transactions to identities, providing transaction-level privacy equivalent to physical cash.
	- ### Core Privacy Mechanism
		- Cashu employs **blind signatures** as its foundational cryptographic primitive, allowing users to request signatures without revealing transaction content to the signer (mint operator).
		- Bearer token model ensures transactions are **peer-to-peer and final**, eliminating transaction reversal and providing cash-like finality.
		- Mint operators gain zero knowledge of individual transaction details while maintaining ability to prevent double-spending through spent-token registry.
		- **Cryptographic guarantees**: Uses Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) with RSA or blind schemes to ensure untraceable transactions while preserving mint security.
		- **Token Blinding Protocol**: Users blind transaction data before sending to mint; mint signs blinded data; users unblind signature to create unlinkable bearer token.
	- ### Bitcoin-AI Integration & AI Agent Privacy
		- **Anonymous AI Service Payments**: AI agents operating in privacy-respecting systems can accept Cashu ecash for services without transaction censorship or identity leakage.
		- **Autonomous Agent Transactions**: Smart contracts and autonomous agents utilise Cashu for inter-agent micro-payments and settlements, enabling censorship-resistant AI economic networks.
		- **Lightning Network Integration**: Cashu seamlessly routes multi-mint transfers through [[Lightning Network]], enabling rapid cross-mint payments and integration with [[L402]] authentication token layer.
		- **Privacy-Preserving AI Coordination**: Agents can coordinate resource allocation, model updates, and computation rewards using Cashu without revealing participant identities or behavioral patterns.
		- **AI Model Monetization**: Content creators and model developers can receive compensation for AI services using Cashu without exposing transaction graphs.
		- **Private Inference Markets**: Decentralized AI inference platforms enable model inference requests paid with anonymous Cashu tokens, protecting user query privacy.
	- ## Technical Architecture & Implementation
		- ### Wallet Implementations (2025)
			- **eNuts**: Production-grade mobile wallet for iOS and Android with NFC support and offline capabilities; actively maintained.
			- **cashu.me**: Progressive Web Application (PWA) wallet accessible from any browser with no installation required; supports multi-mint balances.
			- **Python (nutshell)**: Reference implementation serving as mint backend and wallet library; 451+ GitHub stars, specification-compliant.
			- **Rust (CDK)**: High-performance toolkit enabling enterprise wallet development; actively updated November 2025; bindings for multiple languages.
			- **TypeScript (cashu-ts)**: Browser-native implementation for web-based wallets and integrations; component library approach.
		- ### Mint Architecture
			- Mints are stateless or distributed services issuing Cashu ecash denominations backed by Bitcoin reserves.
			- Multi-mint support allows users to distribute risk across independent mint operators; users can swap between mints using Lightning.
			- Lightning channel integration enables automated Bitcoin-to-ecash conversion with near-zero latency and minimal fees.
			- Solvency proofs and public audit trails maintain transparency without compromising transaction privacy; auditors verify reserves.
			- Mint API exposes keysets, blinded token requests, unblinding operations, and redemption validation endpoints.
	- ## Protocol Security & Privacy Properties
		- ### Privacy Properties
			- **Unlinkability**: Blind signatures ensure mint cannot link mint responses to redemptions (complete transaction unlinkability).
			- **Sender Anonymity**: Sender identity is protected from mint through blind signature protocol; only recipient knows transaction occurred.
			- **Receiver Anonymity**: Receiver can accept payments without revealing identity; bearer token transfers don't require authentication.
			- **Transaction Amount Privacy**: Transaction amounts are visible to parties but not inscribed on-chain or visible to third-party observers.
		- ### Security Properties
			- **Unforgeability**: Cryptographic proofs prevent creation of counterfeit ecash notes without mint authorization; RSA or ECC signatures prevent forgery.
			- **Double-Spend Prevention**: Mint maintains spent notes registry; peer-to-peer transfers require validation against mint database.
			- **Offline Transactions**: Ecash notes can transfer between users offline; validation happens asynchronously against mint within bounded time window.
			- **Denominations**: Fixed-denomination system (similar to physical cash: 1-sat, 5-sat, 10-sat, etc.) prevents value inference.
			- **Keyset Rotation**: Mints regularly rotate keys; new denominations ensure cryptographic freshness and prevent key compromise impacts.
	- ## Wallet Features & User Experience
		- **Multi-Mint Balance Management**: Users maintain separate balances per mint; automatic balance consolidation through Lightning swaps available.
		- **Offline Capability**: Transaction generation and signing occur offline; only final validation requires mint contact.
		- **NFC/QR Payments**: eNuts supports contactless payments via NFC and QR code scanning for point-of-sale terminals.
		- **Token Backup & Recovery**: Ecash tokens can be exported and imported; users maintain local backups for fund recovery.
		- **Denomination Selection**: Automatic denomination selection optimises transaction efficiency; users pay minimal fees.

	- ## Use Cases & Applications
		- **Micropayments**: Content creators accept Cashu for digital goods, articles, and services with minimal fees (typically <1 sat).
		- **Privacy-Respecting Commerce**: E-commerce platforms use Cashu to offer customers transactional privacy by default; no transaction history linked to identity.
		- **Paywall & Subscription Systems**: News publishers and streaming services integrate Cashu for subscription payments with user anonymity.
		- **Organizational Vouchers & Rewards**: Companies issue Cashu for employee benefits, loyalty programmes, and reward systems; redeemable for services.
		- **Cross-Border Remittances**: International transfers with minimal intermediaries using multi-mint Lightning routing; faster than traditional wire transfers.
		- **Privacy-Sensitive Donations**: Nonprofits and activist organizations accept Cashu donations without revealing donor-recipient links.
		- **Gaming & Digital Rewards**: Online games use Cashu for in-game currency and reward distributions with player anonymity preserved.
	- ## Threat Models & Limitations
		- **Mint Trust Assumptions**: Mints must not be compromised; compromised mints can steal user funds but cannot improve privacy (mint-side attacks don't help).
		- **Timing Analysis**: Temporal patterns of transactions can leak information despite cryptographic unlinkability; users should space transactions.
		- **Network-Level Privacy**: IP address and network metadata still visible; users should combine with [[Tor]] or VPN for network-level privacy.
		- **Offline Validation Window**: Offline transactions require validation within bounded timeframe; stale tokens can be challenged by mint.
		- **Denomination Traceability**: Fixed denominations can enable statistical analysis; adversaries with transaction flow visibility may infer patterns.
