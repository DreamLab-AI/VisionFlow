- ## Luma Dream Machine?
	- Luma Dream Machine is a browser-based AI video generator [developed by Luma Labs](https://www.creativebloq.com/ai/luma-dream-machine-makes-ai-video-open-to-all), a San Francisco-based startup. It allows users to generate short videos (around 5 seconds) by simply entering a text or image prompt.
		- **Free to Use**: Luma Dream Machine is free to try, with no waiting list or subscription required. Users get 30 free video generations per month.
		- **High-Quality Output**: The AI produces impressively clean and detailed videos, adhering to prompts accurately and generating relatively coherent motion.
		- **Fast Generation**: Videos are generated in around 2 minutes after entering the prompt.
		- **Consistent Subjects**: Characters and subjects appear consistent throughout the video, capable of expressing emotion better than many previous AI video models.
	- ## Limitations
	  While groundbreaking, and crucially, "available", Luma Dream Machine still has some limitations, as acknowledged by the company:
		- Morphing, warping, and unnatural movements
		- Difficulty with complex scenes or full-body shots
		- Text in videos may appear garbled
		- Anatomical issues like extra limbs or heads
	- [(1) Professor John Keeting on X: "this was created with Luma AI I am very impressed. Made by Kevin Van Witt and the talented team at The Monster Library https://t.co/IXLWO1Be91" / X (twitter.com)](https://twitter.com/ProfKeeting/status/1801632319536607623)

- # The Rest
	- **Lumiere: Google's Contribution** Google's Lumiere project also signifies progress in video generation capabilities, though full details remain undisclosed. This suggests ongoing competition and development  in the field.
	- **Meta's Approach: Foundational World Modelling** Meta (formerly Facebook) is taking a distinct approach, focusing on the underlying world modelling needed for video encoding and generation. This emphasis on understanding the principles of physics and object interactions could contribute to  more realistic AI-generated videos.
	- **Technical Capabilities and Limitations**
		- **Capabilities** Current AI video generators demonstrate proficiency in producing high-resolution images and videos. They are capable of style adaptation, simulating complex scenes with multiple elements, and handling variations in aspect ratio and resolution.
		- **Limitations**  Despite their strengths, these models still struggle to accurately simulate physics and lack a complete understanding of cause and effect. Occasional errors regarding object permanence highlight the existing gap between pattern recognition and a comprehensive understanding of the world.
	- **Ethical and Creative Considerations**
		- **Potential Impacts**  Advancements in AI video generation raise questions about the future of creative professions and the ethical implications of AI-generated content. Balancing technological innovation with safeguarding the integrity of human creativity is an important consideration.
		- **Challenges**  Distinguishing between pattern recognition and genuine understanding is pivotal in the ethical use of AI. The potential for misuse or the creation of harmful content underscores the need for clear guidelines and responsible practices.

- [[MotionDirector]], with a dual-path LoRAs architecture to decouple the learning of appearance and motion. Further, we design a novel appearance-debiased temporal loss to mitigate the influence of appearance on the temporal training objective. Experimental results show the proposed method can generate videos of diverse appearances for the customised motions. Our method also supports various downstream applications, such as the mixing of different videos with their appearance and motion respectively, and animating a single image with customised motions.

Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on real driving videos of 512 x 1024 resolution.
