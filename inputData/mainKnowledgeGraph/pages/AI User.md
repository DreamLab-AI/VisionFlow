## AI User

AI User refers to an individual or entity who interacts with, relies upon, or is affected by the outputs, decisions, or recommendations of an artificial intelligence system in order to accomplish tasks, make decisions, obtain services, or achieve objectives, either through direct system interaction or indirect exposure to ai-mediated outcomes, encompassing both active users who consciously engage with ai systems and passive subjects whose data is processed or whose circumstances are influenced by ai operations.

- Industry adoption and implementations
	- AI systems are now embedded in a wide range of sectors, including healthcare, finance, retail, and public services
	- Notable organisations and platforms
		- NHS Digital in the UK has rolled out AI-driven diagnostic tools and patient management systems
		- Financial institutions like Barclays and NatWest use AI for fraud detection and customer service
		- Retail giants such as Tesco and Sainsbury's employ AI for inventory management and personalised marketing
	- UK and North England examples where relevant
		- Manchester City Council has implemented AI for traffic management and urban planning
		- Leeds City Council uses AI to optimise waste collection routes and improve public service delivery
		- Newcastle University's Institute for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence supports local businesses in adopting AI solutions
		- Sheffield Hallam University collaborates with local SMEs to develop AI-driven training and support programmes
- Technical capabilities and limitations
	- AI systems can process vast amounts of data, provide real-time insights, and automate routine tasks, but they are not infallible and can perpetuate biases present in training data
	- Limitations include the need for high-quality data, the potential for algorithmic bias, and the challenge of ensuring transparency and accountability
- Standards and frameworks
	- The UK government has established the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation (CDEI) to oversee the ethical use of AI
	- The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) provides guidelines for the use of AI in healthcare
	- The British Standards Institution (BSI) has developed standards for AI in various sectors, including ISO/IEC 23894:2023 for AI risk management
