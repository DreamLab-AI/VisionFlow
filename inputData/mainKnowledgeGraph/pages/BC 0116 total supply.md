## Definition [Updated 2025]

### Primary Definition

All existing tokens within [[blockchain]] systems, providing essential functionality for [[distributed ledger technology]] operations and properties. Total supply represents the sum of all tokens that have been created ([[token issuance]]) minus any tokens that have been permanently removed from circulation through [[burning]] mechanisms.

### Technical Definition

A formally-defined component of [[blockchain architecture]] that exhibits specific properties and behaviours according to established protocols and mathematical foundations, enabling secure and decentralized operations. Total supply is calculated as: **Total Supply = Tokens Minted - Tokens Burned**.

### Standards-Based Definition

According to [[ISO/IEC 23257:2021]], this concept represents a fundamental element of blockchain and distributed ledger technologies with specific technical and operational characteristics. Total supply is a key [[tokenomics]] metric used for valuation and investment analysis.

## Examples [Updated 2025]

### Real-World Implementations

#### Example 1: Bitcoin (BTC)

```

Max Supply: 21 million BTC
Circulating Supply: ~19.88 million BTC (>94% of max)
Performance: Predictable issuance, deflationary over time
Use Case: Store of value, digital gold narrative
URL: https://bitcoin.org
```

#### Example 2: Ethereum (ETH)

```
Implementation: No fixed max supply, EIP-1559 burn mechanism
Total Supply: ~120 million ETH (November 2025)
Max Supply: Unlimited (but net issuance can be negative)
Circulating Supply: ~120 million ETH
Performance: Dynamic supply based on network activity
Use Case: Smart contract platform, gas token
URL: https://ethereum.org
```

#### Example 3: Binance Coin (BNB)

```
Implementation: Quarterly burn targeting 100M total supply
Total Supply: ~147 million BNB (November 2025)
Max Supply: 200 million BNB (initial)

Performance: Deflationary through auto-burn mechanism
Use Case: Exchange utility token, BSC gas token
URL: https://www.binance.com
```

## Related Design Patterns

### Architectural Patterns

- **[[Deflationary Model]]**: Burn mechanisms reduce total supply over time
- **[[Fixed Supply Model]]**: Hard cap on total tokens (e.g., Bitcoin)
- **[[Dynamic Supply Model]]**: Supply adjusts based on network conditions (e.g., algorithmic stablecoins)

### Implementation Patterns

- **Best Practice 1**: Implement totalSupply() function in [[ERC-20]] tokens for standard compliance
- **Best Practice 2**: Use [[Chainlink oracles]] for off-chain supply data aggregation
- **Best Practice 3**: Implement [[time-locked vesting]] to manage circulating vs total supply
- **Anti-Pattern**: Hidden pre-mines or undisclosed token reserves that inflate total supply unexpectedly

## Academic Context [Updated 2025]

- The concept of [[total supply]] in [[cryptocurrency]] refers to the total number of coins or tokens that have been created and currently exist, excluding those that have been permanently removed from circulation through [[burning]] mechanisms.
	- It includes coins that are [[circulating]], [[locked]] (e.g., [[staking]], [[vesting]]), or held in reserves.
	- The academic foundation lies in [[tokenomics]], which studies the economic models and [[supply metrics]] of [[digital assets]] to understand [[valuation]], [[scarcity]], and [[inflation risks]].
	- Key distinctions are made between:
		- **[[Max Supply]]**: The absolute cap on tokens that can ever be created
		- **[[Total Supply]]**: Existing tokens minus burned ones
		- **[[Circulating Supply]]**: Tokens available for public trading
