## Byte Pair Encoding

Byte Pair Encoding refers to a subword tokenisation algorithm that iteratively merges the most frequent pairs of characters or character sequences to build a vocabulary, originally developed for data compression.

- Industry adoption and implementations
  - Notable organisations and platforms
    - BPE is widely adopted by major tech companies and research institutions, including OpenAI (GPT-3.5, GPT-4), Google, Meta, and xAI (Grok).
    - The token vocabulary size for models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 is typically around 100,258, with 100,000 tokens from the BPE algorithm and 258 special tokens.
  - UK and North England examples where relevant
    - In the UK, BPE is used in various NLP applications, including language models developed at universities and research centres in Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield.
    - For instance, the University of Manchester’s NLP group has contributed to the development of BPE-based tokenisers for multilingual and low-resource language models.
- Technical capabilities and limitations
  - Capabilities
    - Efficiently handles rare and out-of-vocabulary words by breaking them into subword units.
    - Reduces the vocabulary size, making it easier to work with large datasets and diverse languages.
  - Limitations
    - The choice of vocabulary size can impact model performance, with larger vocabularies potentially leading to overfitting and smaller vocabularies to underfitting.
    - The merging process can sometimes result in suboptimal token boundaries, especially for languages with complex morphological structures.
- Standards and frameworks
  - BPE is a standard component in many NLP frameworks, such as Hugging Face Transformers, spaCy, and AllenNLP.
  - The algorithm is often customised for specific use cases, with variations in the initial vocabulary, merging criteria, and special token inclusion.

- # Advice on AI coding
- **Choose Tools Strategically:** Not all AI coding tools are created equal. Select the right tool for the job, considering the project's scope and complexity:
	- **Complex Applications:** Cursor, Windsurf, or more established IDE integrations (see below) are often better suited for larger, more intricate projects.
	- **Micro-SaaS:** Bolt/Lovable are optimised for smaller, Software-as-a-Service applications.
	- **Mobile Applications:** Replit remains a good choice, alongside framework-specific tools.
	- **UI Design:** Consider using 'vo' or similar specialised tools for user interface design.
	- **General Coding Assistance & IDE Integration:**
		- **GitHub Copilot:** A widely used and powerful AI pair programmer that integrates directly into your IDE (VS Code, JetBrains IDEs, etc.).
		- **GitHub Copilot Agents:** Extend Copilot's capabilities with specialised agents for tasks like code review, debugging, and test generation.
		- **Aider:** A command-line tool that helps you write and edit code using GPT models. Good for making changes to existing codebases, particularly for refactoring and adding features.
		- **Roo**: Provides code generation and chat capabilities within your IDE.
		- **Cline:** Good for command line interfacing, and code assistance.
- **Context is Paramount:** Always provide comprehensive context about your project. AI tools cannot "guess" your intentions. Use Markdown (.md) documents to detail:
	- **Product Requirements Document (PRD):** Clearly outlines the purpose, features, and functionality of the application.
	- **Technical Stack Document:** Specifies the programming languages, frameworks, libraries, and databases to be used.
	- **File Structure:** Defines the organisation of directories and files within the project.
	- **Frontend Guidelines:** Describes coding standards, styling conventions, and component structure for the user interface.
	- **Backend Structure:** Outlines the architecture, API endpoints, data models, and business logic for the server-side code.
	- **Use CodeGuide (or Similar):** Consider using CodeGuide or a similar tool to help generate and manage these AI-specific coding documents. This ensures compatibility across various AI tools and helps maintain a single source of truth.
- **Incremental Development:** Avoid overly broad prompts like "build me an AirBNB clone." Instead, break down the project into manageable steps:
	- **Page by Page:** Develop the application one page at a time.
	- **Component by Component:** Within each page, build individual components sequentially.
	- **Limited Task Execution:** AI models typically perform best with a maximum of 3 concurrent tasks *per request*. Be mindful of this limitation, and break down larger tasks accordingly. Tools like Aider and Copilot Agents can help manage this complexity.
- **Select AI-Friendly Technologies:** Certain technology stacks are better understood by current AI models:
	- **Web Applications:**
		- **React (with NextJS or ViteJS):** Provides excellent performance and is well-supported by AI tools.
		- **Python (with frameworks like Django or Flask):** Widely used and well-understood by AI models.
	- **Mobile Applications:**
		- **React Native:** A good choice for cross-platform development.
		- **SwiftUI (especially with Claude):** Works well, particularly with Claude models.
	- **Avoid Older Technologies**: Unless absolutely necessary, as AI model support may be limited.
- **Utilise Starter Kits:** Save time and reduce token usage by starting with pre-built templates or boilerplates:
	- **Example:** The "CodeGuide NextJS Starter Kit" can provide a solid foundation.
	- **Benefit:** Accelerates workflow and provides a structured starting point. Most frameworks have readily available starter kits.
- **Define Rules Within Your Tools:** Many AI coding tools allow project-specific rules:
	- **Examples:** .cursorrules (often "project rules"), .windsurfrules, or similar configuration files within your IDE or tool. Copilot and other IDE-integrated tools often have settings for coding style and preferences.
	- **Purpose:** Constrain the AI, preventing deviations from your guidelines and coding standards.
	- **Coding Standards**: Enforce coding standards using linters (e.g., ESLint for JavaScript, Pylint for Python) and integrate their configuration with your AI tools where possible.
- **Employ a Multi-Tool Approach:** No single tool handles the entire workflow seamlessly. Combine tools:
	- **Research:** Perplexity.
	- **Brainstorming:** ChatGPT (voice features can be helpful).
	- **Documentation:** CodeGuide, or tools integrated within your IDE.
	- **Data Scraping:** Firecrawl, or libraries within your chosen language (e.g., Beautiful Soup in Python).
	- **Code Generation/Assembly/Refactoring:** Your chosen AI coding tool (Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, Aider, Roo, Cline, etc.). Choose based on your workflow and project needs.
- **Patience and Persistence:** Working with AI requires a specific mindset.
	- **Prompt Engineering:** Crafting effective prompts is crucial. Experiment with different phrasing and levels of detail.
	- **Expect Errors:** AI models are not perfect. Be prepared for errors.
	- **Iterative Refinement:** Stay focused, learn from mistakes, and iteratively refine your prompts and approach.
	- **Debugging**: Provide the AI with the full code and error message for assistance. Leverage Copilot Agents for debugging tasks.
- **Version Control**
	- Use Git for version control.
	- Commit frequently with clear messages.
	- AI can help generate commit messages (Copilot, Aider, and others offer this).
- **Testing**
	- Write unit and integration tests.
	- AI can assist in generating test cases (Copilot Agents are particularly useful here). Tools like Aider can help refactor code to improve testability.

- AI code auto-completion tools like [[Microsoft CoPilot]] have shown the potential for AI to enhance software development. The latest [[Microsoft CoPilot]] leverages [[ChatGPT]] 4 and is extremely good.
- AI will likely be incorporated into most software products going forward to enhance capabilities and engagement. Some experiences are better suited to standalone interfaces rather than cramming functionality into chatbots.
- Effective use of AI tools requires developing specialized skills around prompting, understanding system capabilities and limitations, and framing problems appropriately. Different AI systems have strengths in different domains.
- Software development will transition towards more hybrid human-AI teams, with less focus on writing code line-by-line. AI can provide significant productivity gains by automating rote tasks.
- There are open questions around whether to expose functionality through general chatbot interfaces vs company-specific products. There are strategic and technical considerations favouring bespoke solutions.
- Open source software tends to improve quickly over time and should not be underestimated. However, regulations could potentially suppress open source AI progress.
