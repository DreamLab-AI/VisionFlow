## Definition

**Cryptocurrency Remuneration** enables global teams to receive payments in digital assets, bypassing traditional wire transfers that take 3-5 days and cost 3-5% in fees. Stablecoins (USDC, DAI) pegged to USD avoid cryptocurrency volatility, whilst Lightning Network enables sub-penny transaction fees for microtask payments.

## Advantages

- **Instant Settlement**: Payments confirmed in seconds-minutes
- **Low Fees**: <£0.01 vs. 3-5% PayPal/wire transfer fees
- **Global Access**: Anyone with internet can receive payments
- **Financial Inclusion**: Enables unbanked populations to participate in remote work

## Challenges

- **Volatility**: Bitcoin, Ethereum prices fluctuate (stablecoins mitigate this)
- **Tax Complexity**: Cryptocurrency income/capital gains taxation complicated (HMRC guidance)
- **Regulatory Risk**: Some jurisdictions restrict cryptocurrency use
- **User Experience**: Requires cryptocurrency wallet literacy

## UK Tax Treatment (HMRC)

- Cryptocurrency payments subject to income tax, National Insurance
- Capital gains tax applies to token appreciation (£3,000 annual exemption, 2025)
- Employers paying in crypto must withhold PAYE, NI
