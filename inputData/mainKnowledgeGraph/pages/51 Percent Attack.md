## 51% Attack

51% Attack refers to [[Majority attack]] on [[Proof-of-Work]] [[blockchain]] networks where a single entity or coalition controls more than 50% of the network's [[hash rate]], enabling [[double-spending]], [[transaction censorship]], and [[blockchain reorganization]].

## About 51% Attack
id:: 51%-attack-about
A **51% attack** (also known as a [[majority attack]]) occurs when a single entity or coalition gains control of more than half of the total [[mining]] [[hash rate]] on a [[Proof-of-Work]] (PoW) [[blockchain]] network. This majority control enables the attacker to manipulate the [[blockchain]] by reversing recent [[transactions]], enabling [[double-spending]], and potentially [[transaction censorship|censoring]] or reordering transactions.
Originally considered impractical for large networks like [[Bitcoin]] due to the immense computational power required, the concept has evolved with the proliferation of smaller [[altcoins]], where such attacks have become more feasible and economically viable through [[hash rate]] rental services.

### Key Characteristics

id:: 51%-attack-characteristics
1. **Majority Control**: Attacker controls >50% of network [[hash rate]]
2. **Chain Reorganization**: Ability to create longer [[blockchain]] forks that override honest chain
3. **Double-Spending**: Can reverse recent [[transactions]] to spend same coins twice
4. **Transaction Censorship**: Can prevent specific [[transactions]] from confirming
5. **Limited Scope**: Cannot forge transactions requiring [[private keys]] or create coins from nothing

### Attack Mechanism

id:: 51%-attack-mechanism
**How It Works**:
- Attacker mines blocks faster than the rest of the network combined
- Creates a private fork of the [[blockchain]] containing fraudulent [[transactions]]
- When private chain becomes longer, broadcasts it to network
- [[Consensus]] rules accept longest chain, orphaning honest blocks
- Previously confirmed [[transactions]] are reversed, enabling [[double-spending]]
**Technical Requirements**:
- Control of majority [[hash rate]] (>50% of network computational power)
- Specialized [[mining hardware]] (ASICs for most networks)
- Significant electricity costs
- Coordination of [[mining pools]] (if using multiple sources)

### Real-World Examples [Updated 2025]

id:: 51%-attack-examples

#### Monero Attack (August 2025)

**[Updated 2025]** In August 2025, [[Qubic]], a Layer-1 [[blockchain]] designed for computational [[Proof-of-Work]], directed its [[mining pool]] toward attacking [[Monero]]. The operation achieved:
- Six-block deep [[blockchain reorganization]]
- Approximately 60 orphaned blocks
- [[Qubic]] had configured its network to perform Monero's PoW hashing, earning block rewards while executing the attack
- The [[Monero]] community responded with a [[DDoS attack]] targeting [[Qubic]]'s infrastructure, disrupting coordination and halting the attack
**Significance**: This incident demonstrated that even larger, established [[cryptocurrency]] networks face real threats from well-resourced attackers, moving 51% attacks from theoretical vulnerabilities to practical risks.
*Source: Halborn Security (2025). "Explained: The Monero 51% Attack"*

#### Ethereum Classic (Multiple Attacks)

**[Updated 2025]** [[Ethereum Classic]] (ETC) has been one of the most frequently attacked blockchains:
- **January 2019**: [[Coinbase]] identified a "deep chain reorganization" including [[double-spending]] on January 5, 2019. Coinbase halted all ETC transactions.
- **August 2020**: Massive attack with [[double-spending]] of $5.6 million worth of ETC
- **2020 Series**: Network experienced three additional attacks in 2020, losing over $5 million total
- **2024 Attack**: Further [[double-spending]] incidents and [[transaction]] disruptions, causing financial harm and reputational damage
**Why Targeted**: Lower [[hash rate]] compared to [[Ethereum]], making it economically feasible to rent sufficient computational power for attacks.
*Sources: Coinbase Security (2019), BeInCrypto (2024)*

#### Bitcoin Gold (Ongoing Target)

**[Updated 2025]** [[Bitcoin Gold]] (BTG) has suffered over 40 detected 51% attacks:
- **May 2018**: First major attack with [[double-spending]] of approximately $18 million worth of BTG
- **January 2020**: Attack on January 23-24 resulted in [[double-spending]] of ~$7,000 worth of BTG with two reorganizations exceeding ten blocks
- **Ongoing Vulnerability**: Continues to be targeted due to relatively low [[hash rate]] and [[ASIC]]-resistant algorithm making rental attacks viable
**Why Vulnerable**: [[Bitcoin Gold]]'s lower [[hash rate]] and accessibility of compatible [[mining hardware]] through rental services.

### Economic Analysis

id:: 51%-attack-economics

#### Cost of Attack [Updated 2025]

**Large Networks (Highly Secure)**:
- [[Bitcoin]]: Hash rate exceeds 600 EH/s (exahashes per second)
- Estimated cost: $20+ billion in hardware, plus ongoing electricity costs exceeding $1 million/day
- **Practically immune** due to prohibitive costs
**Smaller Networks (Vulnerable)**:
- [[Ethereum Classic]]: ~150 TH/s
- [[Bitcoin Gold]]: ~5 TH/s
- Attack cost: As low as $50,000-$500,000 via [[hash rate]] rental services like [[NiceHash]]
- **Economically feasible** for motivated attackers with potential profits exceeding costs

#### Attacker Incentives

1. **Financial Gain**: [[Double-spending]] to defraud exchanges
2. **Market Manipulation**: Shorting cryptocurrency before attack to profit from price crash
3. **Competitive Sabotage**: Damaging rival [[blockchain]] networks
4. **Ideological Motivation**: Proving vulnerabilities in specific networks
*Source: MIT Digital Currency Initiative (2023), "Economic Incentives and Feasibility of 51% Attacks"*

### Prevention and Mitigation Strategies [Updated 2025]

id:: 51%-attack-prevention

#### 1. Alternative Consensus Mechanisms

- **[[Proof-of-Stake]] (PoS)**: Replaces [[hash rate]] with token ownership
  - Attack cost shifts from hardware to capital
  - Requires acquiring >50% of token supply (often billions of dollars)
  - Examples: [[Ethereum]] 2.0, [[Cardano]], [[Polkadot]]
- **Hybrid Models**: Combine PoW with PoS or other mechanisms
  - [[Decred]]: Hybrid PoW/PoS system
  - Makes attacks significantly more complex and expensive

#### 2. Checkpointing

- Anchors certain blocks in the chain as immutable
- Limits depth of possible [[blockchain reorganization]]
- Makes deep reorganizations computationally infeasible
- **Trade-off**: Reduces flexibility for legitimate forks and upgrades
- **Example**: [[Ethereum Classic]] implemented checkpointing after 2020 attacks

#### 3. Hash Rate Monitoring

- Real-time monitoring of [[hash rate]] distribution
- Alert systems for sudden spikes in single [[mining pool]] share
- **Best Practice**: No single pool should exceed 25% of network [[hash rate]]
- Tools: Blockchain explorers, mining pool dashboards

#### 4. Increased Decentralization

- Encourage diverse set of [[mining pools]]
- Geographic distribution of mining operations
- Prevent centralization of [[hash rate]]
- Community governance to identify and address concentration risks

#### 5. Economic Barriers

- **Staking Requirements**: [[Ethereum]] requires staking 32 ETH (~$54,000+) to become validator
- **Slashing Penalties**: Validators lose stake for malicious behaviour
- **Bonding Mechanisms**: Economic deterrents for attack attempts

#### 6. Network Upgrades

- Transition to more secure [[consensus]] algorithms
- Implement ASIC-resistant [[mining]] algorithms (with caveats)
- Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments
*Sources: Hacken (2025), MIT DCI, Unchained (2025)*

### Technical Limitations

id:: 51%-attack-limitations
**What Attackers CANNOT Do**:
- Forge transactions requiring [[private keys]]
- Create new coins beyond block rewards
- Access or steal users' wallets
- Modify transactions older than the reorganization depth
- Prevent all transactions permanently (network can recover)
**What Attackers CAN Do**:
- Reverse recent [[transactions]] (typically within last few blocks)
- Execute [[double-spending]] attacks
- Censor specific [[transactions]] or addresses
- Temporarily halt block production
- Create orphaned blocks

### Academic Context

id:: 51%-attack-academic
The academic foundation stems from the [[Bitcoin]] whitepaper by [[Satoshi Nakamoto]] (2008), which assumed the improbability of acquiring majority [[hash rate]]. However, subsequent research has developed sophisticated economic models analysing incentives and feasibility of 51% attacks across various [[cryptocurrencies]].
**Key Research Areas**:
1. **Economic Game Theory**: Analyzing attacker incentives and rational behaviour
2. **Selfish Mining**: Related attack strategy where miners withhold blocks
3. **Hash Rate Rental Markets**: Impact of services like [[NiceHash]] on attack feasibility
4. **Defence Mechanisms**: Checkpointing, finality gadgets, hybrid consensus
5. **Detection Systems**: Real-time monitoring and anomaly detection
