  - **Definition**
    - definition:: AI Operator refers to an individual, organizational role, or entity responsible for the operational management, day-to-day supervision, monitoring, control, and maintenance of an artificial intelligence system during its deployment and active use phase, exercising human oversight, configuring operational parameters, responding to incidents and anomalies, coordinating system maintenance and updates, ensuring continuous performance and safety, managing user interactions and feedback, enforcing governance policies, maintaining audit trails and documentation, and ensuring the AI system operates reliably, safely, effectively, and in compliance with established organizational policies, technical specifications, ethical guidelines, and applicable regulatory requirements within specific operational contexts and use cases. This operational role encompasses activities including system configuration and parameter tuning adapting the AI system to operational requirements, performance monitoring and observability tracking system health, prediction quality, and operational metrics, incident detection and response identifying anomalies, failures, or unexpected behaviors requiring intervention, user support and training assisting end users in effective and responsible system interaction, data quality oversight ensuring input data meets quality standards and flagging distributional shifts, model behavior review analyzing system outputs for correctness, fairness, and alignment with intended use, human oversight implementation exercising meaningful human control over high-stakes or sensitive decisions, governance compliance verification ensuring adherence to policies, procedures, approval workflows, and regulatory obligations, documentation maintenance recording system configurations, incidents, interventions, and operational decisions, stakeholder communication reporting performance, issues, and impacts to management and affected parties, and continuous improvement contributing operational insights to development teams for system enhancement. Operator responsibilities vary by system risk level and deployment context, with EU AI Act Articles 26-27 defining operator obligations for high-risk systems including use in accordance with instructions, ensuring input data quality, monitoring system operation, retaining automatically generated logs, implementing human oversight, and reporting serious incidents within 15 days, while operator competencies require technical understanding of AI system capabilities and limitations, domain expertise relevant to application context, ethical awareness of fairness and bias implications, regulatory knowledge of applicable compliance requirements, and incident management skills for rapid and effective response, formalized through emerging standards including ISO/IEC 42001:2023 AI management systems defining operator roles.
