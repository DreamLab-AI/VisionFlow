- ## About ProofOfStake
	- [[Proof of Stake]] (PoS) is a [[consensus mechanism]] for [[blockchain]] networks where [[validators]] are selected to create and validate [[blocks]] based on the amount of [[cryptocurrency]] they hold and are willing to "stake" as [[collateral]]. Unlike [[Proof of Work]] (PoW), which requires extensive [[computational power]] and [[energy consumption]], PoS replaces computational work with economic stake, making it significantly more [[energy-efficient]] while maintaining [[network security]] through economic incentives.

- ## Core Definition and Principles
	- ### Fundamental Concept
		- **Economic Security Model**: PoS secures [[blockchain networks]] through [[economic incentives]] rather than computational difficulty
		- **Validator Selection**: [[Network participants]] are chosen to propose and validate [[blocks]] based on their staked [[tokens]]
		- **Stake as Collateral**: [[Validators]] must lock up [[cryptocurrency]] as security deposit, which can be forfeited ([[slashing]]) for malicious behaviour
		- **Energy Efficiency**: Eliminates the need for energy-intensive [[mining]] operations required by [[Proof of Work]]
		- **Accessibility**: Lowers [[barriers to entry]] compared to PoW [[mining]], requiring [[capital investment]] rather than specialized [[hardware]]

	- ### Historical Development
		- **2011**: First PoS concept proposed as alternative to [[Bitcoin]]'s [[Proof of Work]]
		- **2012**: [[Peercoin]] becomes first [[cryptocurrency]] to implement PoS alongside PoW (hybrid model)
		- **2014**: [[Ethereum]] announces plans to transition from PoW to PoS in its [[roadmap]]
		- **2017**: [[Cardano]] launches with [[Ouroboros]] PoS [[protocol]]
		- **2020**: [[Ethereum]] launches [[Beacon Chain]], beginning multi-year transition to PoS
		- **2022**: [[Ethereum Merge]] completes, transitioning [[Ethereum]] from PoW to PoS (99.95% [[energy reduction]])
		- **2025**: PoS becomes dominant [[consensus mechanism]] for major [[blockchain platforms]]

- ## Proof of Stake Mechanisms
	- ### Validator Selection Methods
		- **Random Selection**
			- [[Validators]] chosen pseudo-randomly using [[verifiable random functions]] (VRFs)
			- Selection probability weighted by [[stake amount]]
			- Used by [[Ethereum]] ([[Casper FFG]]), [[Cardano]] ([[Ouroboros]])
			- Prevents predictability and [[validator manipulation]]

		- **Age-Weighted Selection**
			- Considers both [[stake amount]] and [[staking duration]] (coin age)
			- Older stakes have higher selection probability
			- Implemented in early PoS systems like [[Peercoin]]
			- Encourages long-term [[network participation]]

		- **Delegated Selection**
			- [[Token holders]] vote for [[delegates]] who become [[validators]]
			- Fixed number of active [[validators]] (e.g., 21-101 delegates)
			- Used in [[Delegated Proof of Stake]] (DPoS) systems
			- Examples: [[EOS]], [[Tron]], [[Lisk]]

		- **Nominated Selection**
			- [[Nominators]] select trusted [[validators]] and stake with them
			- [[Validators]] compete for [[nominations]] based on [[reputation]] and [[commission rates]]
			- Implemented in [[Polkadot]]'s [[Nominated Proof of Stake]] (NPoS)
			- Combines [[decentralization]] with [[security]]

	- ### Consensus Finality
		- **Probabilistic Finality**
			- [[Transaction]] finality increases over time with each new [[block]]
			- Similar to [[Bitcoin]]'s confirmation model but faster
			- Lower [[security guarantees]] but higher [[throughput]]

		- **Deterministic Finality**
			- [[Transactions]] are immediately final once confirmed
			- Implemented through [[Byzantine Fault Tolerant]] (BFT) [[consensus]]
			- Examples: [[Tendermint]] ([[Cosmos]]), [[Casper FFG]] ([[Ethereum]])
			- Higher [[security]] but potentially lower [[throughput]]

		- **Economic Finality**
			- Reverting finalised [[blocks]] becomes economically irrational
			- Cost to attack exceeds potential gains
			- Core security assumption of [[Ethereum]]'s [[Casper]]

		- **Post-Merge**: ~0.0026 TWh annually (equivalent to small town)
		- **Carbon Emissions**: Reduced from 53 Mt CO2 to 870 tons annually
		- **Sustainability**: Addressed major [[ESG]] concerns for institutional adoption

	- ### Economic Impact
		- **Supply Dynamics**
			- [[Issuance]] dropped from ~4.3% to ~0.55% annually
			- [[EIP-1559]] [[fee burning]] creates potential [[deflationary]] pressure
			- Net [[issuance]]: Often negative during high [[network activity]]

		- **Staking Economy**
			- $30+ billion staked in first year post-Merge
			- [[Liquid staking]] protocols grew to $20+ billion [[TVL]]
			- [[Validator]] [[decentralization]]: Over 1 million validators

		- **Market Reaction**
			- Reduced [[sell pressure]] from [[miners]]
			- Increased institutional interest due to [[energy efficiency]]
			- [[Staking yield]] attracted [[capital]] from [[TradFi]]

- ## Validator Economics
	- ### Staking Rewards Structure
		- **Base Rewards**
			- Determined by total amount staked network-wide
			- Inversely proportional to total stake (more stake = lower APY)
			- [[Ethereum]]: 3.5-5.5% APY (varies with [[participation rate]])
			- [[Cardano]]: 4-5% APY
			- [[Solana]]: 6-8% APY
			- [[Polkadot]]: 10-15% APY
			- [[Cosmos]]: 15-20% APY

		- **Additional Rewards**
			- [[Transaction fees]]: Distributed to [[block proposers]]
			- [[MEV]] (Maximal Extractable Value): Additional revenue for [[validators]]
			- [[Priority fees]]: User-paid fees for faster inclusion
			- [[Protocol emissions]]: Some chains have [[inflationary]] rewards

		- **Reward Calculation Factors**
			- **[[Participation rate]]**: Higher participation = lower individual rewards
			- **[[Uptime]]**: Must maintain high [[availability]] (95%+ typically)
			- **[[Attestation performance]]**: Correct and timely [[attestations]]
			- **[[Block proposals]]**: Random selection provides bonus rewards
			- **[[Network activity]]**: Higher [[transaction volume]] = higher [[fee income]]

	- ### Penalties and Slashing
		- **Minor Penalties**
			- **[[Inactivity leak]]**: Gradual stake reduction for offline [[validators]]
			- **[[Missed attestations]]**: Small penalties for not participating
			- **[[Late attestations]]**: Reduced rewards for delayed responses
			- Typical penalty: 0.001-0.01% of stake per incident

		- **Major Slashing Events**
			- **[[Double signing]]**: Proposing two different blocks for same slot
			- **[[Surround voting]]**: Contradictory [[attestations]]
			- **[[Equivocation]]**: Any provably malicious behaviour
			- Penalties: 0.5 ETH minimum, up to entire stake (Ethereum)
			- [[Correlation penalty]]: Higher if many validators slashed simultaneously

		- **Slashing Impact**
			- Immediate [[validator]] ejection from [[active set]]
			- Stake locked for [[withdrawal delay period]]
			- [[Reputation]] damage affecting future [[delegations]]
			- Network-wide [[correlation penalty]] during mass slashing

	- ### Operational Costs
		- **Infrastructure Requirements**
			- [[Hardware]]: Modern server (16GB+ RAM, 2TB+ SSD)
			- [[Bandwidth]]: Stable internet (100+ Mbps recommended)
			- [[Redundancy]]: Backup systems to prevent downtime
			- [[Electricity]]: Minimal compared to PoW (~100-300W)

		- **Annual Costs (Solo Staking)**
			- [[Hardware]]: $500-2,000 initial investment
			- [[Electricity]]: $100-300/year
			- [[Internet]]: $300-1,200/year
			- [[Maintenance]]: Time and technical expertise
			- Total: $1,000-4,000/year for serious operation

		- **Profitability Analysis**
			- Break-even varies with [[stake size]] and [[rewards]]
			- 32 ETH stake @ 4% APY = 1.28 ETH/year
			- Profitable if [[rewards]] exceed costs + [[opportunity cost]]
			- [[Economies of scale]] favour larger operations

- ## Staking Types and Accessibility
	- ### Solo Staking (Self-Custody)
		- **Requirements**
			- [[Ethereum]]: Minimum 32 ETH (~$100,000+ USD in 2025)
			- Technical knowledge to run [[validator node]]
			- [[Hardware]] and reliable [[internet connection]]
			- 24/7 [[uptime]] maintenance

		- **Advantages**
			- Full control over [[private keys]] and [[rewards]]
			- Maximum [[decentralization]] contribution
			- No [[third-party]] [[counterparty risk]]
			- Direct [[protocol participation]]

		- **Disadvantages**
			- High [[capital requirement]]
			- Technical complexity and maintenance burden
			- Risk of [[slashing]] if misconfigured
			- No [[liquidity]] until [[withdrawals]] enabled

	- ### Pooled Staking
		- **Concept**
			- Multiple users combine stakes to reach minimum threshold
			- [[Pool operators]] manage [[validator nodes]]
			- Rewards distributed proportionally to contributions

		- **Major Platforms**
			- **[[Lido]]**: Largest [[liquid staking]] protocol ($30+ billion TVL)
			- **[[Rocket Pool]]**: [[Decentralized]] [[staking pool]] (16 ETH mini-pools)
			- **[[StakeWise]]**: [[Dual-token]] staking (sETH2 + rETH2)
			- **[[Ankr]]**: Multi-chain staking services

		- **Pool Economics**
			- [[Commission fees]]: 5-10% of staking rewards
			- [[Smart contract]] risk from pooling protocol
			- [[Liquid staking tokens]] represent staked position
			- Can trade or use [[LSTs]] in [[DeFi]] while earning rewards

	- ### Liquid Staking Protocols
		- **Mechanism**
			- Stake [[tokens]] and receive [[derivative tokens]] (LSTs)
			- [[LSTs]] tradeable and usable in [[DeFi]] protocols
			- Maintains [[liquidity]] while earning [[staking rewards]]
			- Example: Stake ETH, receive [[stETH]] (Lido Staked ETH)

		- **Benefits**
			- Solves [[liquidity]] problem of traditional staking
			- [[Capital efficiency]]: Use staked assets as [[collateral]]
			- Lower [[barriers to entry]] (no minimum requirement)
			- Professional [[node operators]] reduce [[slashing risk]]

		- **Risks and Concerns**
			- [[Smart contract vulnerabilities]]
			- [[De-pegging]] risk (LST value vs. underlying asset)
			- [[Centralization]] concerns (Lido controls 30%+ of Ethereum validators)
			- [[Regulatory uncertainty]] around [[staking services]]

		- **2025 Statistics**
			- Total [[liquid staking]] market: $50+ billion
			- [[Lido]] market share: ~60% of liquid staking
			- [[Rocket Pool]]: Growing [[decentralized]] alternative
			- [[LST]] integration: 200+ [[DeFi protocols]]

	- ### Centralized Exchange Staking
		- **Major Providers**
			- [[Coinbase]]: ~10% of Ethereum validators
			- [[Binance]]: ~8% of Ethereum validators
			- [[Kraken]]: ~5% of Ethereum validators
			- [[Crypto.com]], [[Gemini]], others

		- **User Experience**
			- Simplest option: Click to stake
			- No technical knowledge required
			- No minimum amount (can stake <1 ETH)
			- Rewards automatically distributed

		- **Trade-offs**
			- Give up [[custody]] to exchange
			- [[Counterparty risk]] (exchange insolvency)
			- Lower rewards due to exchange fees
			- Reduces [[network decentralization]]
			- [[Regulatory risk]] (exchanges may be restricted)

- ## Security Model and Attack Vectors
	- ### Economic Security Fundamentals
		- **Game Theory Foundation**
			- [[Validators]] have "skin in the game" via staked capital
			- Attacking network requires controlling 51%+ of stake
			- Cost to attack proportional to [[network value]]
			- [[Slashing]] makes attacks economically irrational

		- **Security Assumptions**
			- [[Rational actors]]: Validators maximise profit
			- [[Honest majority]]: >66% of stake is honest ([[BFT]] threshold)
			- [[Liquidity]]: Cannot easily acquire 51%+ of total supply
			- [[Value correlation]]: Attack destroys attacker's own wealth

	- ### Nothing-at-Stake Problem
		- **Attack Description**
			- [[Validators]] can vote for multiple [[fork]] chains simultaneously
			- No [[computational cost]] to support all forks (unlike PoW)
			- Could support chain splits without penalty

		- **Solutions Implemented**
			- **[[Slashing conditions]]**: Penalize validators voting for conflicting chains
			- **[[Finality gadgets]]**: Lock in canonical chain after threshold
			- **[[Economic penalties]]**: Make multi-voting economically irrational
			- **[[Casper FFG]]**: Ethereum's solution with slashing for contradictory votes

	- ### Long-Range Attacks
		- **Attack Mechanism**
			- Attacker acquires old [[private keys]] from former validators
			- Constructs alternative [[blockchain history]] from distant past
			- Presents forged chain to new network participants
			- Possible because old validators no longer have stake at risk

		- **Defence Mechanisms**
			- **[[Weak subjectivity]]**: Nodes checkpoint recent blocks
			- **[[Withdrawal delays]]**: Keep validators bonded for extended periods
			- **[[Key rotation]]**: Regular validator key updates
			- **[[Social consensus]]**: Community awareness of canonical chain
			- [[Ethereum]] requires nodes sync within 4 months to avoid long-range attacks

	- ### Stake Grinding Attack
		- **Attack Vector**
			- Manipulate [[validator selection]] by trying multiple [[block]] variations
			- Exploit any predictability in [[randomness]] source
			- Increase probability of being selected as [[block proposer]]

		- **Countermeasures**
			- **[[VRF]] (Verifiable Random Functions)**: Unpredictable, verifiable randomness
			- **[[RANDAO]]**: Collective randomness from multiple validators
			- **[[Commit-reveal schemes]]**: Prevent manipulation of randomness
			- **[[Look-ahead periods]]**: Select validators for future slots in advance

	- ### Centralization Risks
		- **Validator Concentration**
			- Large [[staking pools]] control significant stake percentage
			- [[Lido]] controls ~30% of Ethereum validators (2025)
			- [[Exchanges]] collectively control ~25% of Ethereum validators
			- Risk of [[cartel formation]] or [[censorship]]

		- **Mitigation Efforts**
			- [[Rocket Pool]]'s [[decentralized]] mini-pools (16 ETH vs 32 ETH)
			- [[DVT]] (Distributed Validator Technology) splits validator control
			- Community pressure for [[Lido]] to self-limit
			- [[Protocol-level limits]] on single entity stake percentage (proposed)

- ## Proof of Stake vs Proof of Work
	- ### Energy Efficiency Comparison
		- **Proof of Work**
			- [[Bitcoin]]: ~150 TWh annually (comparable to Argentina)
			- Requires specialized [[ASIC miners]] consuming 3,000+ watts
			- [[Carbon footprint]]: 65+ Mt CO2 annually (Bitcoin)
			- [[E-waste]]: Significant from obsolete mining hardware

		- **Proof of Stake**
			- [[Ethereum]]: ~0.0026 TWh annually (99.95% reduction)
			- Standard computers consuming 100-300 watts
			- [[Carbon footprint]]: ~870 tons CO2 annually (Ethereum)
			- Minimal [[hardware waste]]

		- **Sustainability Impact**
			- PoS enables [[ESG]]-compliant institutional adoption
			- Addresses environmental criticisms of [[cryptocurrency]]
			- Compatible with [[renewable energy]] goals

	- ### Security Trade-offs
		- **Proof of Work Security**
			- [[Physical security]]: Attacks require real-world [[hardware]] and [[electricity]]
			- [[Objective consensus]]: Longest chain rule is deterministic
			- [[Attack cost]]: External to network ([[mining equipment]])
			- [[51% attack]]: Requires majority of [[hashrate]]

		- **Proof of Stake Security**
			- [[Economic security]]: Attacks require controlling majority of [[stake]]
			- [[Subjective consensus]]: Relies on [[weak subjectivity]] checkpoints
			- [[Attack cost]]: Internal to network (must acquire tokens)
			- [[Slashing]]: Attackers lose staked capital

		- **Security Comparison**
			- PoS has higher [[cost to attack]] when stake equals network value
			- PoW vulnerable to [[hash rate]] concentration and [[ASIC manufacturing]]
			- PoS vulnerable to [[stake concentration]] and [[long-range attacks]]
			- Both secure when properly implemented with sufficient participation

	- ### Decentralization Characteristics
		- **Proof of Work**
			- [[Economies of scale]] favour large [[mining operations]]
			- [[Geographic concentration]] near cheap electricity
			- [[ASIC manufacturers]] have outsized influence
			- [[Mining pools]] necessary for small miners (centralization)

		- **Proof of Stake**
			- Lower [[barriers to entry]] (no specialized hardware)
			- [[Staking pools]] concentrate stake but more accessible than mining
			- [[Liquid staking]] creates new centralization vectors
			- Potential for [[plutocracy]] (wealth concentration = power concentration)

	- ### Economic Implications
		- **Proof of Work**
			- [[Inflation]] funds [[miner]] rewards (continuous sell pressure)
			- [[Mining]] transfers value outside network to electricity providers
			- [[Hashrate]] follows price (death spiral risk during crashes)

		- **Proof of Stake**
			- Lower [[issuance]] needed to secure network
			- Value stays within network ecosystem
			- [[Staking]] creates [[opportunity cost]] (reduced circulating supply)
			- Potential for [[deflationary]] economics with [[fee burning]]

- ## Finality in Proof of Stake Systems
	- ### Gasper (Ethereum)
		- **Protocol Composition**
			- [[Casper FFG]] (Friendly Finality Gadget): Provides finality
			- [[LMD GHOST]] (Latest Message Driven Greedy Heaviest Observed SubTree): Block selection
			- Combined approach balances [[liveness]] and [[safety]]

		- **Finality Mechanism**
			- [[Epochs]]: 32 slots (~6.4 minutes)
			- [[Justification]]: Supermajority vote (66%+) justifies epoch
			- [[Finalization]]: Justified epoch becomes final when next epoch justified
			- Typical finality time: ~15 minutes (2 epochs)

		- **Inactivity Leak**
			- Emergency mechanism during prolonged network partition
			- Gradually reduces stake of non-participating validators
			- Allows network to recover finality with active validators

	- ### Tendermint (Cosmos, others)
		- **Instant Finality**
			- [[BFT consensus]]: 2/3+ majority vote finalises blocks
			- [[Block time]]: 6-7 seconds
			- [[Finality]]: Immediate upon block commitment
			- No [[chain reorganizations]] possible after finalization

		- **Trade-offs**
			- Stronger finality guarantees
			- Lower [[throughput]] than probabilistic systems
			- Network halts if <66% validators available

	- ### Other Finality Approaches
		- **[[GRANDPA]] (Polkadot)**
			- Finalises chains rather than individual blocks
			- Can finalise multiple blocks simultaneously
			- Highly efficient for finalising backlogs

		- **[[Ouroboros Praos]] (Cardano)**
			- [[Probabilistic finality]] similar to Bitcoin
			- Progressively stronger guarantees with confirmations
			- ~15-20 blocks (~5-7 minutes) for practical finality
