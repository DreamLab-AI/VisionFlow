- I was listening to "Pod Save America" last night, and they were sneering (quite rightly) at the politically motivated Trump appearance at this year's major Bitcoin Conference. I was struck by how only Tommy Vietor seemed to have a sense of the thing they were mostly missing here. He said that Trump had latched onto two things; money (hundreds of millions in donations), and Young Men as a voting block. He sounded like it caught in the back of his throat a bit and it occurred to be that the left might have a real blind spot here, in a way they wouldn't about, let's say Taylor Swift, who has been mentioned on the show lots of times in terms of her potent economic and political cache.
- This will, when I get back from camping, become a proper article, potentially with some actual humour, but I can't the hack at the bottom of the field.. I just can't.
- In the meanwhile, this is my point: Money and a significant voting block is NOT nothing in this, or even any election. The things that community have been asking for all along are not even particularly difficult to do, being mainly a cessation of abuse through vexatious court actions.
- Honestly, if the Dems lose by a number of votes that could conceivably have been in this bit of noise here, then they really do need to consider the term sneering elites in a more nuanced light. The VAST majority of bitcoin and crypto holders are financially dispossessed and basically having a mad punt.
