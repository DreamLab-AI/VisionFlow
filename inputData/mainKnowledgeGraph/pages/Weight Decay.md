## Weight Decay

Weight Decay refers to a regularisation technique that adds a penalty proportional to the magnitude of weights to the loss function, encouraging smaller weight values. weight decay (l2 regularisation) prevents overfitting by limiting model complexity and promoting simpler solutions.

- Weight decay remains a cornerstone regularisation method in both academia and industry for training robust machine learning models, including large language models (LLMs).
  - It is integrated into popular frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, and is a default hyperparameter in many training pipelines.
- Notable organisations employing weight decay include tech giants and research labs worldwide, with increasing interest in adaptive weight decay methods that tune the decay coefficient dynamically during training.
- In the UK, machine learning research groups at universities such as the University of Manchester and the University of Leeds actively explore weight decay’s role in improving model generalisation and robustness.
  - Regional AI hubs in North England, including Sheffield and Newcastle, contribute to advancing optimisation techniques incorporating weight decay.
- Technical limitations include the challenge of tuning the weight decay coefficient \(\lambda\), which can significantly affect model performance if set improperly.
  - Recent advances propose adaptive schemes to mitigate this, improving stability and robustness without extensive hyperparameter search.
- Weight decay is often used alongside other regularisation methods such as dropout, with complementary effects on reducing overfitting.
