## Academic Context

- Brief contextual overview
	- Reality capture systems are interdisciplinary tools bridging computer vision, geomatics, and digital heritage, enabling the creation of high-fidelity digital representations of physical environments
	- The field has evolved from early photogrammetric techniques to integrated sensor platforms combining LiDAR, photogrammetry, and robotics
- Key developments and current state
	- Modern systems are increasingly automated, scalable, and interoperable with Building Information Modelling (BIM) and digital twin workflows
	- Research focuses on improving accuracy, reducing processing time, and enabling real-time data integration
- Academic foundations
	- Rooted in photogrammetry (dating back to the 19th century) and laser scanning (developed in the 1960s)
	- Contemporary work draws from computer science, surveying, and architectural technology

## Current Landscape (2025)

- Industry adoption and implementations
	- Widely used in construction, urban planning, heritage conservation, and facility management
	- Major platforms include RealityCapture (Epic Games), Bentley ContextCapture, and Autodesk ReCap
	- UK and North England examples where relevant
		- Manchester’s Smart City initiatives employ reality capture for urban infrastructure monitoring
		- Leeds City Council uses drone-based photogrammetry for heritage site documentation
		- Newcastle University’s Digital Heritage Lab applies laser scanning to historic buildings
		- Sheffield’s Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC) integrates reality capture into industrial digitalisation projects
- Technical capabilities and limitations
	- Capable of millimetre-accurate point clouds, textured 3D meshes, and real-time data streaming
	- Limitations include hardware cost, data processing demands, and challenges in complex or dynamic environments
	- Systems now support mixed sensor inputs (LiDAR, photogrammetry, thermal imaging) and robotic automation
- Standards and frameworks
	- ISO 19157 (Geographic information — Data quality) and ISO 19115 (Metadata) provide guidance for data quality and interoperability
	- UK BIM Framework and PAS 1192 series support integration with construction workflows
