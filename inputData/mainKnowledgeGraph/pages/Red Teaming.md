### Relationships
- is-subclass-of:: [[AISecurity]]

Red teaming involves adversarial testing where human evaluators or automated systems probe for failure modes, informing alignment training and safety improvements.

# Red Teaming: Ontology Entry Review and Enhancement

I appreciate the detailed brief, though I should clarify that the search results provided don't contain information about UK-specific red teaming implementations, North England innovation hubs, or regional case studies. I'll work with what's available and note where gaps exist.

## Academic Context

- Red teaming as a structured security practice
  - Originated in military strategic simulations during the Cold War, where "blue teams" defended against hypothetical "red teams"
  - Adapted into cybersecurity as a mature, well-established discipline with defined standards (MITRE ATT&CK, NIST 800-53, OSSTMM)[3]
  - Extended into AI safety testing, though definitions remain somewhat fluid compared to traditional cybersecurity applications[3]
  - Borrowed terminology reflects the field's evolution: from military strategy through infrastructure defence to contemporary AI alignment concerns

- Foundational principle
  - Proactive vulnerability identification before adversarial exploitation occurs[1][5]
  - Distinguishes itself from routine quality assurance by challenging assumptions and uncovering blind spots[4]

## Current Landscape (2025)

- Core methodology and scope
  - Simulates adversarial attacks on AI systems under real-world conditions[5]
  - Expands beyond traditional infrastructure security to target the AI model itself, data pipelines, APIs, and real-time interactions[5]
  - Follows structured four-phase approach: threat modelling, adversarial simulation, adversarial testing, and capabilities testing[1][2]

- Specific attack vectors in AI red teaming
  - Prompt injection: manipulating model behaviour through carefully crafted inputs[1]
  - Harmful output generation: forcing language models to produce toxic, biased, or non-compliant content[1]
  - Jailbreak attempts: bypassing intended safeguards and behaviour constraints[1]
  - Denial of wallet/service: triggering excessive compute usage affecting performance and cost[1]
  - Data-driven threats including model poisoning and adversarial data exposure[5]

- Industry adoption
  - Rapidly gaining traction across organisations from smaller technology companies to Fortune 100 enterprises[2]
  - Particularly critical in sensitive contexts: public sector AI, healthcare policy, transportation infrastructure, and national security applications[4]
  - Practical example: customer service AI systems often reveal undetected vulnerabilities during red teaming, such as inadvertent leakage of internal documentation[1]

- Technical distinctions from traditional red teaming
  - Traditional red teaming targets network security, application vulnerabilities (SQL injection, RCE, XSS), and social engineering vectors with well-defined fixes[5]
  - AI red teaming addresses security and ethics overlap, including bias, misinformation, hallucinations, and trustworthiness issues not typical in conventional cybersecurity[5]
  - AI attack surface evolves dynamically as models retrain, requiring continuous rather than periodic assessment[5]

- Governance and standards
  - NIST emphasises testing and evaluation as essential for building trustworthy AI systems[4]
  - Effective red teaming requires well-defined safety policies outlining specific risks, harmful behaviour categories, and measurable thresholds[6]
  - Must account for multimodal inputs and changing contextual factors (time, user location, system updates)[6]

## Research & Literature

- Foundational sources
  - NIST Cybersecurity Resource Centre: "artificial intelligence red-teaming" defined as structured testing effort to find flaws and vulnerabilities in AI systems, often in controlled environments with developer collaboration[8]
  - Georgetown Centre for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET): Comprehensive analysis of red-teaming conceptualisation, distinguishing between cybersecurity origins and AI-specific applications, with emphasis on the fuzzier definitions in generative AI contexts[3]

- Contemporary frameworks
  - Prompt Security: Detailed methodology covering threat modelling, actionable insights for strengthening system prompts, output filters, and compliance reinforcement[1]
  - Hack The Box: Three-category framework distinguishing adversarial simulation, adversarial testing, and capabilities testing as distinct but complementary approaches[2]
  - Wiz Academy: Comparative analysis of AI red teaming versus traditional red teaming, highlighting data-driven threats and evolving attack surfaces[5]

- Emerging perspectives
  - World Economic Forum (2025): Red teaming as systematic approach to proactive vulnerability identification, emphasising the need for AI systems to "fail safely" and building societal confidence in AI[6]
  - Carnegie Mellon SEI: Recognition that generative AI red-teaming can benefit substantially from established cybersecurity practices and methodologies[9]

## UK Context

*Note: The available search results do not contain specific information about UK-based red teaming implementations, North England innovation hubs, or regional case studies. This section would require additional sources to populate accurately.*

- Potential areas for investigation
  - UK government adoption of red teaming for public sector AI systems
  - Academic contributions from UK institutions (particularly Russell Group universities)
  - Regional technology clusters and their engagement with AI safety practices
  - GCHQ or National Cyber Security Centre guidance on AI red teaming standards

## Future Directions

- Emerging technical challenges
  - Scaling red teaming efforts to match the rapid deployment pace of generative AI systems[6]
  - Developing standardised metrics for measuring red teaming effectiveness across diverse AI applications
  - Addressing the dynamic nature of AI systems that retrain continuously, requiring adaptive testing methodologies[5]

- Evolving threat landscape
  - Multimodal attack vectors as AI systems incorporate vision, audio, and text processing[6]
  - Supply chain vulnerabilities in AI development and deployment pipelines
  - Sophisticated adversarial techniques that exploit emerging model capabilities

- Research priorities
  - Formalising definitions and taxonomies for AI red teaming to match the maturity of traditional cybersecurity frameworks[3]
  - Developing automated red teaming capabilities to complement human expertise
  - Integrating red teaming earlier in the AI development lifecycle rather than as a post-deployment exercise
  - Cross-disciplinary collaboration between security specialists, AI researchers, ethicists, and domain experts

**Note on limitations:** The current search results provide comprehensive technical and methodological coverage but lack UK-specific implementations, North England case studies, and recent developments from late 2025. To fully satisfy your requirements, additional sources focusing on British AI governance, regional innovation initiatives, and contemporary UK institutional contributions would be beneficial. The entry as revised above reflects current best practice as of November 2025, though some assertions would benefit from verification against the latest NIST and UK government guidance documents.
