- ## About BC 0112 inflationary token
	- ### Primary Definition
		- **[Updated 2025]** Inflationary tokens are digital assets whose total supply increases over time through mechanisms such as [[mining]], [[staking rewards]], or protocol-level minting[^1]. This model incentivizes network participation and liquidity but can lead to token value dilution if demand does not keep pace with supply growth[^2].
		- The concept draws from traditional economic inflation principles, adapted to programmable [[tokenomics]] within [[blockchain ecosystems]][^3].
	- ### Technical Definition
		- A formally-defined component of [[blockchain architecture]] that exhibits continuous supply expansion according to established protocols and mathematical foundations, enabling [[decentralized]] operations while maintaining network security through economic incentives[^4].
		- Inflationary tokens use [[smart contracts]] or protocol-level logic to mint new tokens at regular intervals, with rates determined by governance mechanisms or fixed schedules[^5].
	- ### Standards-Based Definition
		- According to [[ISO/IEC 23257:2021]], this concept represents a fundamental element of blockchain and [[distributed ledger technologies]] with specific technical and operational characteristics related to token supply management and economic incentive structures[^6].

- ## Academic Context
	- **[Updated 2025]** Inflationary tokens are [[digital assets]] whose total supply increases over time, typically through mechanisms such as [[mining]] or [[staking rewards]][^7].
		- This model incentivizes [[network participation]] and [[liquidity]] but can lead to token value dilution if demand does not keep pace with supply growth[^8].
		- The concept draws from traditional [[economic inflation]] principles, adapted to programmable [[tokenomics]] within [[blockchain ecosystems]][^9].
	- ### Key Academic Foundations
		- **Economic Theories of Inflation**: Application of traditional monetary theory to digital token supply dynamics[^10]
		- **[[Game Theory]] in Incentive Design**: Analysis of how inflationary rewards influence participant behaviour and network security[^11]
		- **[[Cryptoeconomics]]**: Study of token supply dynamics' effects on network security and user behaviour[^12]
		- **Consumer Perception Studies**: Research on how staking yields and token inflation affect attractiveness and adoption[^13]
- ## Current Landscape (2024-2025) **[Updated 2025]**
	- ### Prevalence and Major Examples
		- Inflationary tokens remain prevalent in [[blockchain networks]] that prioritize active participation and ecosystem growth[^14].
		- **Notable Examples:**
			- **[[Dogecoin]] (DOGE)**
				- Removed supply cap in 2014; now has unlimited supply[^15]
				- Mints 10,000 DOGE per block (~5 billion DOGE added annually)[^16]
				- Inflation rate decreases as total supply grows but remains significant[^17]
			- **[[Solana]] (SOL)**
				- Inflation rate ~6.5% in early 2024[^18]
				- Community voting in 2024 on proposals to reduce inflation for long-term sustainability[^19]
				- Distributes inflationary rewards to validators via [[staking]][^20]
			- **[[Ethereum]] (ETH) Post-Merge**
				- Transitioned from [[proof-of-work]] to [[proof-of-stake]] in September 2022[^21]
				- [[EIP-1559]] and staking rewards create hybrid model[^22]
				- Annualized inflation rate fluctuates between 0% and 1% as of 2024[^23]
				- Periods of net negative issuance due to [[fee burning]][^24]
				- Can exhibit net-deflationary behaviour depending on network activity[^25]
			- **[[Cardano]] (ADA)**
				- Low inflation model, currently ~4% per year[^26]
				- Projected to approach 0% by 2050[^27]
	- ### Hybrid Models **[Updated 2025]**
		- **[[Hybrid inflationary-deflationary models]]** combine inflationary issuance with deflationary mechanisms to balance supply dynamics[^28].
		- Examples include:
			- [[Ethereum]]'s [[EIP-1559]] with [[fee burning]]
			- Protocol-level adjustments via [[DAO governance]]
			- Dynamic inflation rates responding to network metrics[^29]
	- ### UK and North England Context **[Updated 2025]**
		- **[[UK blockchain ecosystem]]** has seen significant growth in 2024-2025:
			- **[[FinTech]] contribution**: £5 billion per year to North England economy (2024), projected £6 billion by 2030[^30]
			- **UK FinTech investment** in 2024: $3.6 billion (second-largest globally)[^31]
			- **Regional Distribution:**
				- **[[Manchester]]**: 175 FinTech firms (58% of North England)[^32]
				- **[[Leeds]]**: 94 FinTech firms (30% of North England)[^33]
				- **[[Newcastle]]**: 44 FinTech firms (12% of North England)[^34]

			- [[Smart contracts]] enable transparent and predictable token issuance schedules[^45]
			- [[DAO governance]] mechanisms allow dynamic adjustment of inflation parameters[^46]
		- **Minting Mechanisms**

		- **[[Staking Rewards]]**
			- [[Proof-of-stake]] chains distribute new tokens to validators/stakers[^50]

			- Smart contracts manage reward distribution with vesting schedules[^52]
		- **[[Fee Burning]] and Deflationary Offsets**
			- [[Ethereum]]'s [[EIP-1559]] burns transaction fees to offset inflation[^53]
			- Can result in net deflation during high network activity[^54]

- ## Notes
	- **Implementation Considerations**:
		- Carefully calibrate inflation rates to balance participation incentives with value preservation[^227]
		- Implement transparent governance for inflation parameter changes[^228]
		- Regular economic audits recommended to assess inflation impact[^229]
	- **Historical Context**:
		- Term "inflationary token" emerged with rise of [[PoS]] consensus mechanisms[^230]
		- Distinction from traditional currency inflation: programmable and transparent[^231]
	- **Common Misconceptions**:
		- **Myth**: All inflationary tokens lose value over time
			- **Reality**: Value depends on demand growth relative to supply increase[^232]
		- **Myth**: Inflation is always bad for token holders
			- **Reality**: Inflation rewards active participants and secures networks[^233]
	- **Practical Deployment Guidance**:
		- Start with conservative inflation rates (2-5% annually)[^234]
		- Implement governance mechanisms for future adjustments[^235]
		- Model various economic scenarios before launch[^236]
		- Consider hybrid models with deflationary offsets[^237]
