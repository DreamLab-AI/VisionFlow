	- definition:: A Chatbot is a software application that simulates human conversation through text or voice interactions, automating customer service, information retrieval, and task completion through natural language dialogue. Chatbots range from rule-based systems to sophisticated AI-powered conversational agents employing large language models, intent classification, and dialogue management to provide responsive, context-aware interactions across messaging platforms, websites, and voice interfaces.
