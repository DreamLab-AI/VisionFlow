## Nakamoto Consensus

Nakamoto Consensus refers to bitcoin-style consensus within blockchain systems, providing essential functionality for distributed ledger technology operations and properties.

- Industry adoption and implementations
  - Nakamoto Consensus underpins Bitcoin and several other major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin
  - Notable organisations and platforms
    - Bitcoin Core developers maintain the reference implementation
    - Ethereum Classic continues to use PoW-based Nakamoto Consensus, distinguishing itself from Ethereum’s transition to PoS
  - UK and North England examples where relevant
    - UK-based exchanges such as CoinCorner and Bitstamp support Bitcoin and other PoW blockchains
    - Academic institutions in Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield have active blockchain research groups exploring consensus mechanisms
    - The Northern Blockchain Consortium, a collaboration between universities and industry partners in the North of England, investigates practical applications of Nakamoto Consensus in supply chain and fintech contexts
- Technical capabilities and limitations
  - Capabilities
    - Provides robust security against double-spending and Sybil attacks
    - Enables permissionless participation and censorship resistance
  - Limitations
    - High energy consumption due to PoW
    - Limited transaction throughput compared to newer consensus models
    - Susceptible to 51% attacks if mining power becomes concentrated
- Standards and frameworks
  - No formal international standard for Nakamoto Consensus, but best practices are documented in Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) and academic literature
  - The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and ISO/TC 307 have begun exploring blockchain consensus standards, though Nakamoto Consensus is not yet formally codified
