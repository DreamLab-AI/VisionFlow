# Infrastructure Layer – Updated Ontology Entry

## Academic Context

- The Infrastructure Layer represents the foundational technological substrate enabling metaverse functionality and scalability[1][2]
  - Comprises interconnected systems spanning computing, storage, networking, and security domains
  - Conceptualised within Jon Radoff's seven-layer metaverse framework as the base upon which all higher-order capabilities depend[2]
  - Distinguished from application layers by its focus on enabling technologies rather than user-facing experiences

- Core architectural principle: abstraction of complexity
  - Physical hardware and network topology hidden from end-users through standardised APIs and service interfaces
  - Enables seamless content delivery across heterogeneous devices and geographic locations[1]

## Current Landscape (2025)

- Computing and processing infrastructure
  - Data centres and server farms optimised for high-performance computing, consuming 20-45 kW per rack versus 5-10 kW for traditional computing[6]
  - GPU acceleration critical for rendering, AI model inference, and real-time spatial computation[2][3]
  - Edge computing increasingly distributed to consumer devices, reducing latency and centralised processing bottlenecks[2]
  - Cloud platforms (AWS, Google Cloud Platform) providing elastic autoscaling for variable user loads[4]

- Network connectivity
  - 5G networks dramatically improving bandwidth and reducing latency for responsive real-time interactions[2]
  - 6G infrastructure in development phases, anticipated to further enhance connectivity capabilities[3]
  - Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and load balancers distributing content geographically for optimised user experience[4]
  - InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) enabling decentralised content hosting without centralised server dependency[2]

- Storage and data management
  - Distributed storage systems supporting persistent digital twins—digital replicas of physical objects and locations fed by real-world data[5]
  - Blockchain-based storage for immutable asset ownership records and transaction histories[5]
  - Redundant power systems and failover mechanisms ensuring service continuity[6]

- Security and authentication infrastructure
  - Encryption protocols protecting user data and privacy across distributed systems[1]
  - Access control mechanisms and cybersecurity protocols establishing trusted environments[1]
  - Smart contract auditing and regulatory alignment for blockchain-based asset management[4]

- Energy infrastructure challenges
  - Advanced cooling systems consuming 30-40% of data centre energy budgets[6]
  - Projected carbon footprint of 77-125 million metric tonnes CO₂ annually by 2030 if powered by fossil fuels[6]
  - Renewable energy integration emerging as critical sustainability requirement for scalable deployment[6]

- Standards and frameworks
  - Service-oriented architecture patterns using Kubernetes and Docker containerisation[4]
  - ERC-721/ERC-1155 standards for non-fungible token implementation[4]
  - ERC-20 token standards for in-platform economies and governance mechanisms[4]
