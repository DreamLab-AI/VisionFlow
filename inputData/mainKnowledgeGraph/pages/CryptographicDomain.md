  - ## About CryptographicDomain
    id:: cryptographic-domain-about
    - The CryptographicDomain constitutes a specialized sub-domain within the broader BlockchainDomain, focusing specifically on the cryptographic foundations that enable blockchain security, integrity, and verifiability. Cryptography is not merely an implementation detail of blockchain systems but rather a fundamental architectural component that defines what blockchains can achieve: immutable data structures through hash linking, verifiable ownership through digital signatures, privacy-preserving computation through zero-knowledge proofs, and coordinated action through threshold cryptography. This domain emerged from the recognition that blockchain-specific cryptographic requirements often differ from traditional cryptographic applications, particularly in their emphasis on public verifiability, performance in distributed settings, and resistance to economic attacks rather than just computational attacks.

    - The domain is structured around several categories of cryptographic primitives and protocols. **Cryptographic hash functions** form the foundation, providing one-way, deterministic mappings from arbitrary input to fixed-size digests with strong security properties: collision resistance (infeasibility of finding two inputs with the same hash), preimage resistance (inability to reverse the hash), and second preimage resistance (difficulty of finding alternative inputs with matching hashes). In blockchain systems, hash functions serve multiple roles: linking blocks through hash chains (creating immutability), generating addresses from public keys, creating compact commitments to data, and enabling Merkle trees for efficient inclusion proofs. Common hash functions include SHA-256 (used in Bitcoin), Keccak-256 (used in Ethereum), and RIPEMD-160 (used in Bitcoin addresses).

    - **Digital signature schemes** provide authentication and non-repudiation, allowing blockchain participants to prove ownership of assets and authorise transactions. The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) has been widely adopted due to its small key and signature sizes, though Schnorr signatures are increasingly favored for their simplicity, provable security, and signature aggregation capabilities. Advanced signature schemes like multi-signatures (requiring multiple parties to jointly sign), threshold signatures (allowing k-of-n parties to generate valid signatures), and BLS signatures (enabling efficient signature aggregation) support more sophisticated authorization models and improve scalability. These signature schemes must balance security, performance, key size, and signature size while operating in adversarial environments where economic incentives may motivate sophisticated attacks.

    - **Zero-knowledge proof systems** represent a transformative cryptographic technology that enables privacy-preserving blockchain applications. These protocols allow one party (the prover) to convince another party (the verifier) that a statement is true without revealing any information beyond the statement's validity. zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge) provide extremely compact proofs with fast verification but require a trusted setup ceremony. zk-STARKs (Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge) eliminate the trusted setup requirement and offer post-quantum security but generate larger proofs. Bulletproofs provide short proofs without trusted setup, particularly efficient for range proofs. These zero-knowledge systems enable private transactions (hiding transaction amounts and participants), private smart contracts, scalability solutions (validity rollups), and compliance (proving regulatory compliance without revealing private data).

    - ### Scope and Boundaries
      - **Included:** All cryptographic primitives, protocols, and mechanisms used within blockchain and distributed ledger systems, including hash functions, digital signatures, encryption schemes, zero-knowledge proofs, threshold cryptography, multi-party computation protocols, Merkle tree structures, cryptographic commitments, and post-quantum cryptographic approaches for blockchain applications.

      - **Excluded:** General-purpose cryptography not applied to blockchain contexts (e.g., TLS/SSL protocols, PGP encryption, general authentication protocols), symmetric encryption schemes not used in blockchain systems, classical cryptographic systems predating public-key cryptography, and cryptanalysis techniques unless specifically relevant to blockchain security analysis.

      - **Boundary Clarifications:** Inclusion in CryptographicDomain requires both cryptographic nature and blockchain application. For example, SHA-256 belongs here when used for block hashing and proof-of-work, while general uses of SHA-256 outside blockchain contexts would belong in a broader cryptography domain. Merkle trees belong here because they are fundamental to blockchain data structures, while general tree data structures belong elsewhere. Digital signatures belong here when used for transaction authorization, while general digital signature theory might belong in a broader domain.

    - ### Relationship to Other Classifications
      - **Parent Domain - BlockchainDomain:** CryptographicDomain is a specialized sub-domain of BlockchainDomain, focusing specifically on cryptographic foundations while the parent domain encompasses the full breadth of blockchain technology. All concepts in CryptographicDomain are also members of BlockchainDomain, but the specialized domain provides finer-grained classification for cryptographic concepts. This hierarchical relationship allows users to explore either all blockchain concepts broadly or cryptographic concepts specifically.

      - **Peer Sub-Domains:** CryptographicDomain shares the BlockchainDomain parent with ConsensusDomain (consensus mechanisms and agreement protocols) and TokenEconomicsDomain (economic models and incentive structures). These three sub-domains represent distinct but complementary aspects of blockchain systems: cryptography provides security and verifiability, consensus provides coordination and agreement, and token economics provides incentive alignment. Many blockchain concepts involve multiple sub-domains; for example, Proof-of-Work involves cryptographic hash functions (CryptographicDomain) in a consensus mechanism (ConsensusDomain) with economic incentives (TokenEconomicsDomain).

      - **Layer Relationship - SecurityLayer:** While CryptographicDomain is a domain classification indicating subject matter, SecurityLayer is a layer classification indicating implementation context and abstraction level. Many concepts in CryptographicDomain are implemented in SecurityLayer, indicating that they represent security-focused implementations. For example, Hash Function belongs to CryptographicDomain (it's a cryptographic concept) and SecurityLayer (it's a security implementation). This dual classification provides rich semantic relationships enabling multi-dimensional ontology queries.

    - ### Design Rationale
      - **Separation from General Cryptography:** CryptographicDomain focuses specifically on blockchain-relevant cryptographic concepts rather than cryptography broadly. This scoping decision reflects that blockchain cryptography has distinctive characteristics: emphasis on public verifiability (anyone can verify, not just designated parties), performance constraints from distributed verification (proofs must be efficiently verifiable by many nodes), economic security models (attackers are economically motivated, security must account for incentives), and specific protocol requirements (particular signature schemes, hash functions, or zero-knowledge systems designed for blockchain use cases). This specialized focus enables more relevant and actionable classification for blockchain practitioners.

      - **Hierarchical Sub-Domain Structure:** Organizing CryptographicDomain as a sub-domain of BlockchainDomain rather than a peer domain reflects the foundational role of cryptography in blockchain systems. Cryptography is not an alternative to blockchain but rather a component of blockchain technology. This hierarchical structure accurately represents conceptual relationships while enabling flexible navigation: users can explore all blockchain concepts or drill down into cryptographic specifics.

      - **Balance of Theory and Practice:** The domain includes both theoretical cryptographic concepts (security properties like collision resistance, soundness and completeness of proof systems, computational hardness assumptions) and practical implementations (specific hash functions like SHA-256, signature schemes like ECDSA, zero-knowledge systems like Groth16). This balance serves both researchers studying blockchain security and practitioners implementing blockchain systems.

      - **Evolution and Emerging Cryptography:** The domain structure accommodates both established cryptographic primitives (SHA-256, ECDSA, Merkle trees) that are battle-tested in production blockchains and emerging cryptographic innovations (zk-STARKs, threshold signatures, post-quantum approaches) that represent future directions. As quantum computing advances threaten current cryptographic assumptions, post-quantum cryptography becomes increasingly relevant to blockchain security, and the domain structure supports this evolution.

      - **Cross-Cutting Security Theme:** While CryptographicDomain is a domain classification, many of its concepts also belong to SecurityLayer, reflecting the cross-cutting nature of security in blockchain systems. This dual classification enables users to explore security concepts across all domains (not just cryptography) while also enabling focused exploration of cryptographic concepts specifically. The ontology's multi-dimensional classification system (domains and layers) captures these cross-cutting concerns effectively.
