## Academic Context

- Brief contextual overview
  - Digital Citizens’ Assemblies represent a modern evolution of deliberative democracy, leveraging digital technologies to facilitate structured, inclusive, and representative policy co-creation
  - The core principle remains the same as traditional citizens’ assemblies: randomly selected participants, balanced information, expert input, and collective reasoning
  - Digital formats, including extended reality (XR) and AI-assisted deliberation, have expanded accessibility and scalability, enabling broader participation across geographical and socio-economic boundaries

- Key developments and current state
  - The integration of digital platforms has allowed for hybrid and fully virtual assemblies, increasing reach and reducing barriers to entry
  - Recent years have seen a surge in interest from both academic and policy communities, driven by the need for more responsive and inclusive governance models
  - The Global Citizens’ Assembly initiative, supported by organisations such as Iswe Foundation and Democracy International, exemplifies the growing momentum for digital and global citizens’ assemblies

- Academic foundations
  - Theoretical underpinnings draw from deliberative democracy, participatory governance, and digital citizenship
  - Key scholars include David Farrell, Jane Mansbridge, and Dennis Snower, whose work has shaped the understanding of citizens’ assemblies and digital engagement

## Current Landscape (2025)

- Technical capabilities and limitations
  - Capabilities
    - Extended reality (XR) spaces provide immersive environments for deliberation, enhancing engagement and understanding
    - AI-assisted tools can help participants access complex information, improve contributions, and facilitate cross-language communication
    - Digital platforms enable real-time feedback, data collection, and analysis, supporting evidence-based decision-making
  - Limitations
    - Digital divide: Not all citizens have equal access to the necessary technology and internet connectivity
    - Privacy and security concerns: Ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of participants’ data is crucial
    - Moderation and facilitation: Effective moderation is essential to maintain a respectful and productive deliberative environment

- Standards and frameworks
  - The Global Citizens’ Assembly initiative has established guidelines for transparency, access, and wider participation, including the use of digital platforms to make recommendations publicly available
  - The UK government and local authorities have developed frameworks for digital citizens’ assemblies, focusing on inclusivity, representation, and accountability
