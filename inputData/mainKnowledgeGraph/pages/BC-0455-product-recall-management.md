- ## About Product Recall Management
	- Blockchain-powered systems for rapid, precise product recall execution, reducing recall scope by 70-85% through granular traceability whilst accelerating contamination source identification from days to seconds. These platforms transform food safety, automotive, pharmaceutical, and consumer electronics recalls through immutable supply chain tracking, automated consumer notification, and surgical precision in affected product identification. Walmart's pioneering implementation reduced mango traceability from 6 days 18 hours to 2.2 seconds, whilst automotive blockchain pilots enable component-level recalls affecting 15,000 vehicles instead of 1.5 million. Major deployments include IBM Food Trust's network covering £25+ billion in food products annually, MediLedger's pharmaceutical recall system preventing £130 million in counterfeit drug incidents, and automotive consortia (MOBI) tracking 45+ million connected vehicles for safety-critical component recalls across Toyota, GM, BMW, and Ford.

			- £55 billion annual global cost of product recalls across all industries
			- 450+ food recalls annually in US alone (FDA), affecting 48 million people with foodborne illness
			- 30-50 million vehicles recalled annually worldwide for safety defects
			- £2.5 billion annual pharmaceutical recall costs (counterfeit, contamination, packaging errors)
			- 15-20% of consumer electronics face recalls within first 3 years
			- 40% of recalled products never recovered due to inability to locate affected items
			- Average recall takes 57 days from contamination to public notice (food industry)
			- Consumer safety: 3,000 deaths annually attributable to recalled products not recovered
		- **Traditional Recall Inefficiencies**
			- Over-recall waste: 70-85% of recalled product volume unaffected but destroyed for lack of precision
			- Traceability gaps: inability to identify contamination source in <6 days (food industry standard)
			- Consumer notification failure: only 20-30% of affected consumers reached in automotive recalls
			- Supply chain complexity: food products pass through average 7-10 intermediaries obscuring origin
			- Data fragmentation: recall information spread across incompatible systems (suppliers, distributors, retailers)
			- Cost of imprecision: £30-50 million per major food recall due to overly broad scope
			- Brand damage: 60% of consumers permanently switch brands after recall experience
		- **Food Safety Specific Challenges**

			- Commingling: mixed batches from multiple suppliers preventing precise source identification
			- Limited shelf life: perishable products discarded before recall notices issued (30-40% waste)
			- Batch tracking inadequacy: paper-based lot codes lost or illegible in 25% of cases
			- Cross-contamination risks: inability to identify all potentially exposed products
			- Regulatory pressure: FDA Food Safety Modernization Act requiring end-to-end traceability
		- **Automotive and Electronics Challenges**
			- Component complexity: modern vehicles contain 30,000+ parts from 3,000+ suppliers
			- Multi-tier supply chain: defects traced through 4-6 tiers taking months
