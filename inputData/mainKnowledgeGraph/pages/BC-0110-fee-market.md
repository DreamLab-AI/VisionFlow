		- #### Regulatory and Market Dynamics
			- Regulatory environments are likely to influence the battle between traditional search engines and AI-driven alternatives. The European Union's challenges in legislating competition within the search market underscore the dominance of established entities like Google. However, AI-driven search engines like Search GPT might benefit from regulatory shifts aiming to break monopolistic hold, thereby fostering competition and innovation.

	- #### NFT marketplaces
- NFT markets are far more centralised services which match ‘owners’ ofdigital assets with potential buyers. The concept is a staple of themore recent interpretation of Web3, even though in practice these seemto be centralised concerns. [Opensea](https://opensea.io/) claims to bethe largest decentralised NFT marketplace, but they have the ability to[remove listings](https://thedefiant.io/sad-frogs-delisted-opensea/) inresponse to legal challenges. This seems to fly in the face of Web3principles. NFTs are currently a [deeplyflawed](https://tante.cc/2021/12/17/the-third-web/) technology but seemlikely to persist and will be covered later.

		- ### **5. Voluntary Adoption**
			- Standards are voluntarily adopted and success is determined by the market.

	- ##### NEOSVR
		- [Notable because](https://neos.com/) it’s trying to integrate cryptomarketplaces, but we haven’t tried it yet.

	- ### Costs and Benefits
		- Energy Market Dynamics: The reliance on fluctuating energy markets poses risks for nuclear power, which has high fixed costs and is best suited for baseload power generation.
		- Tech Companies' Role: Big tech firms initially claimed 100% renewable energy while relying heavily on fossil fuels, leading to credibility issues and increased demand for stable power sources.
		- Offshore Wind vs. Nuclear: Offshore wind projects are generally more expensive (£140-£260 per megawatt hour) and do not provide the guaranteed power delivery that nuclear can, especially critical for large data centres.
		- Reliability of Power Supply: Nuclear energy offers a more reliable power source compared to intermittent renewable sources, particularly for meeting peak demand.
		- The successful restart of Three Mile Island could pave the way for new nuclear projects, leveraging existing sites and infrastructure.
		- Low-Hanging Fruit: Several unfinished nuclear plants across the U.S. could be viable candidates for completion due to their existing permits and infrastructure.
		- The changing stance of tech companies toward nuclear energy reflects a broader acceptance of nuclear as a clean energy source, potentially influencing future energy policy.
		- Impact on Energy Prices: As nuclear plants resume operation, the energy market dynamics may shift, leading to higher electricity prices for consumers while providing significant revenue for operators.

	- ### PolitiFi: Early Political Speculation
		- Tokens representing political candidates
		- Biden and Trump tokens reached $700 million combined market cap
		- These products led the  "betting markets" craze which accumulated far more attention

- # Global monetary policy
	- The term “don’t fight the Fed” has been used in trading circles for many years. Owing to the pre-eminent role of the dollar in global market sactions of the political and central banking bodies which impact the dollar always have global reach. It is worth knowing that these decisions are usually contested, and worse, the power of the decision makers seems rooted in their narrative impact. It’s a pretty terrible system given the impact on billions of lives. The Federal ReserveSystem, which is comprised of a Board of Governors, 12 regional banks,and an Open Market Committee, is a privately-owned central banking system in the United States. The member banks of each Federal ReserveBank vote on the majority of the Reserve Bank’s directors and the directors vote on members to serve on the Open Market Committee, which determines monetary policy. The president of the New York FederalReserve Bank is traditionally given the vice chairmanship of the OpenMarket Committee and is a permanent committee member. This means thatprivate banks are the key determinants in the composition of the OpenMarket Committee, which regulates the entire economy. The FederalReserve is an independent agency and its monetary policy decisions donot have to be approved by the President or anyone else in the executive or legislative branches of government. The Fed’s profits are returned tothe Treasury each year, but the member banks’ shares of the Fed earnthem a 6% dividend. The 2008 financial crisis and subsequent bailouts exposed the fundamental conflicts of interest at the heart of theFederal Reserve System, where the very banks that caused the crisis were the recipients of the trillions of dollars in bailout money. These conflicts of interest were baked into the Federal Reserve Act over 100 years ago and are a structural feature of the institution. The concentration of power within this group is staggering.

	- ### Displays & Headset Hardware
		- Awaiting a bit more market stability for this section. Of note is thatMicrosoft seems to be [abandoningHololens](https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/microsoft-has-laid-off-entire-teams-behind-virtual-mixed-reality-and-hololens),and Apple seem to have postponed their commodity AR headset.
		- Microsoft think that creating the Perfect Illusion, that of alife-likeness in VR will require a field of view of 210 horizontal and135 vertical, 60 pixels per degree subtended, and a refresh rate of 1800Mhz according to Microsoft. They expect this by as soon as2028.[[cuervo2018creating]]
		- With the advent of[WebGPU](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/webgpu/)alongside WebGL everything is likely to converge on the browserexperience.

	- ### Growth Drivers and Market Dynamics
		- The increasing digitalisation of services and the advent of [[Agents]] have amplified demand for smaller, pay-per-use pricing structures.
		- Traditional subscription models are criticised for their inflexibility, especially for irregular or low-volume usage of streaming content, IoT device connectivity, or AI tool APIs.
		- Organisations such as the [[European Central Bank]] emphasise the importance of collaborative micropayment ecosystems, highlighting how even small publishers or niche content producers can monetise effectively without exorbitant fees.
		- Examples like Boingo’s airport WiFi pricing (USD $0.12–0.18 per minute) show how usage-based billing can work in small increments, illustrating the viability of micropayment infrastructure.

				- ### Potential Future Trends
					- Looking ahead, King warns that the current market rally might be reliant on fragile liquidity conditions. As central bank support wanes, particularly with tighter fiscal policy, he anticipates increased volatility and vulnerability within the markets. He suggests that while rate cuts might be anticipated, they may not stimulate the desired credit growth and could reveal existing market weaknesses[](https://www.bis.org/publ/mktc11.pdf)[](https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap66b.pdf).

				- ### Political and Geopolitical Risks
					- King expresses concerns about the pricing of political risks in the current environment, emphasising that markets tend to underestimate the potential for significant regime shifts or drastic economic changes due to accumulated debt. Political factors often lead to abrupt market re-evaluations, typically occurring when confidence erodes suddenly and unexpectedly[](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/mb201309_focus05.en.pdf)[](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165188922002858).

		- ### Capture by traditional finance [[Update Cycle]]
			- As the popularity of Bitcoin continues to grow, traditional financial market incumbents have begun to take notice. In an effort to assert their dominance and protect their interests, these incumbents have turned to regulation and acquisition as means of capturing the growing markets. This is most clear in the ’alt coin’ space where traditional banks have leveraged their knowledge and marketing to transfer money from retail investors into their own venture capital operations. This is not to say that Bitcoin is immune from these harms.
			- Scalability is always going to be a problem for Bitcoin, for all the reasons discussed in the blockchain chapter. There is no “ready to go” solution (except perhaps federations) that could onboard the whole world at this time because of the limited number of available UTXOs.
			- Finally, a lack of fungibility, and privacy by default in Bitcoin,trends towards blacklists and over time this could seriously compromisethe use of the asset.

- ### The Disjunction
	- With approximately 2 million Bitcoin reportedly liquid on exchanges at this moment, the market is relatively thin compared to the vast global financial markets. If a large portion of Bitcoin investment shifts to these ETFs, forced through tax compliance laws in the USA, there could be a significant discrepancy between the "paper" Bitcoin and actual Bitcoin supply-demand dynamics. The real crunch comes when, for any reason, a substantial number of ETF holders decide to convert their holdings into actual Bitcoin. The ETFs, being cash-settled, might not be backed by an equivalent amount of real Bitcoin. This disjunction between the paper and physical Bitcoin could lead to a crisis of trust and liquidity.

- ### Global vs. U.S. Market Dynamics
	- While the U.S. might spearhead this form of Bitcoin investment through ETFs, the global Bitcoin market remains diverse and less regulated in many jurisdictions. International holders and traders of actual Bitcoin might react differently to the ETF market movements, leading to potential arbitrage situations or exacerbating the liquidity crisis if they lose confidence in the price stability and seek to liquidate their holdings for fiat or other assets.

International holders and traders of actual Bitcoin might react differently to the ETF market movements, leading to potential arbitrage situations or exacerbating the liquidity crisis if they lose confidence in the price stability and seek to liquidate their holdings for fiat or other assets.

- ### The Disjunction
	- With approximately 2 million Bitcoin reportedly liquid on exchanges at this moment, the market is relatively thin compared to the vast global financial markets. If a large portion of Bitcoin investment shifts to these ETFs, forced through tax compliance laws in the USA, there could be a significant discrepancy between the "paper" Bitcoin and actual Bitcoin supply-demand dynamics. The real crunch comes when, for any reason, a substantial number of ETF holders decide to convert their holdings into actual Bitcoin. The ETFs, being cash-settled, might not be backed by an equivalent amount of real Bitcoin. This disjunction between the paper and physical Bitcoin could lead to a crisis of trust and liquidity.
