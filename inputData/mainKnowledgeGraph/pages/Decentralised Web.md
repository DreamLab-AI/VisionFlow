- ## Web3
	- More recently Web3 is [being touted](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=web3) as a way to connect content creators directly to content consumers, without centralised companies acting as gatekeepers of the data. It implies that all users have a cryptographic key management system, to which they attach metadata, that they make requirements of peers with whom they communicate, and that they maintain trust 'scores' with peers.
	- It seems likely that this new model is less driven by a market need, and more by the high availability of tools which allow this to happen (the ecosystems described later). Add to this a social response to the [collapse in trust of companies such as Facebook](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-facebook-worst-company-of-the-year-yahoo-finance-165345819.html) and other [social media platforms](https://reb00ted.org/tech/20220727-end-of-social-networking/)\[[4](https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx4)\] (Figure [2.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#Ch2.F2 "Figure 2.2 ‣ 2.3 Web3 ‣ Chapter 2 Decentralisation & The Web ‣ Part I State of the art")). There is perhaps a wish by consumers to pass more of the economic incentive to content creators, without the 'rent seeking' layer afforded by businesses, and a healthy dose of mania driven market speculation. [Edelman's latest trust report](https://www.edelman.co.uk/sites/g/files/aatuss301/files/2022-01/2022%20Edelman%20Trust%20Barometer_UK.pdf) is shocking, finding that trust in all institutions has slumped recently to all time lows, and their global survey found that: ["Nearly 6 in 10 say their default tendency is to distrust something until they see evidence it is trustworthy. Another 64% say it's now to a point where people are incapable of having constructive and civil debates about issues they disagree on. When distrust is the default -- we lack the ability to debate or collaborate."]

- ##### 2.3.1 Emerging consensus
  The recent hype cycle ignored the legacy definitions described above and instead focusing almost exclusively on Ethereum based peer-to-peer projects. It can be seen that the description is somewhat in the eye of the beholder.
  It's possible to frame this Ethereum Web3 as a hugely complex and inefficient digital rights management system (DRM). DRM is something that users of the internet are increasingly familiar and comfortable with. It's somewhat debatable whether decentralising this is worthwhile. The thesis of the developers of the technology seems to be that without it, control of 'value' will accrete over time, to one or more hegemonic controlling entities. It's a strong argument, but there is a [substantial counter argument](https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html) emerging that users just don't want this stuff. The nervousness of legislators in the USA to the attempt by Facebook/Meta to enter this peer-to-peer value transmission space is telling in terms of the perception of who is driving Web3.
  Throughout 2022 there was much furore on the internet over what Web3 might be, and who it 'serves'. Enthusiasts feel that products such as [Sign-In with Ethereum](https://blog.spruceid.com/sign-in-with-ethereum-is-a-game-changer-part-1/) (EIP-4361) might give users choice over their data sovereignty, and a meme to this effect is seen in Figure [2.3](https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#Ch2.F3 "Figure 2.3 ‣ 2.3.1 Emerging consensus ‣ 2.3 Web3 ‣ Chapter 2 Decentralisation & The Web ‣ Part I State of the art"). In practice though users are expecting to use badly written, buggy, economically vulnerable 'crypto' wallets to log into websites. The quality of this wallet software is improving of late with the so called "wallet wars" seeing commerce grade offerings from Coinbase and shares platform 'Robinhood'. These two companies alone have over 100 million users. It's likely that these wallets will evolve to offer the full spectrum of Web3 functionality. With that said it doesn't seem to make much sense yet on the face of it. There are in fact examples of the technology completely failing at censorship resistance. Popular 'Web3' browser extension Metamask and NFT platform Opensea have both [recently banned countries](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2022/03/03/iranian-venezuela-users-abruptly-dropped-from-major-crypto-platforms-as-russian-sanctions-grow/?sh=22bcabc470b0) in response to global sanction pressure. This failure to meaningfully decentralise will be explored further in the distributed identity section.
  ![Figure 2.3: A meme showing differing approached to logging in on a website.](../assets/web1web2web3.jpg) Of their 2022 ['Big Ideas' report](https://research.ark-invest.com/thank-you-big-ideas-2022?submissionGuid=0937b1ae-9e11-4b46-ae03-6cd8d2f8301b), ARK investment LLC (who manage a \$50B tech investment) [said the following](https://www.ark-bigideas.com/2022/en/pages/download) (Figure [2.4](https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#Ch2.F4 "Figure 2.4 ‣ 2.3.1 Emerging consensus ‣ 2.3 Web3 ‣ Chapter 2 Decentralisation & The Web ‣ Part I State of the art")), which connects some of the dots already mentioned, and leads us into the next section which is Blockchain and Bitcoin:
  ["While many (with heavily vested interests) want to define all things blockchain as web3 we believe that web3 is best understood as just 1 of 3 revolutions that the innovation of bitcoin has catalysed.] ![Figure 2.4: [ARK slide on Web3.](https://twitter.com/wintonARK/status/1486143239753060353) Rights requested](../assets/Web3ARK.jpg) This new hyped push for Web3 is being driven by enormous venture capital investment. A16Z are a [major player](https://a16z.com/2022/01/07/9b-to-build-the-future/) in this new landscape and have released their [ten principles](https://a16z.com/2022/01/07/how-to-build-a-better-internet-10-principles-for-world-leaders-shaping-the-future-of-web3/) for emergent Web3. Note here that A16Z are (like so many others) probably a [house of cards](https://twitter.com/coryklippsten/status/1592242420137148416).
    Establish a clear vision to foster decentralized digital     infrastructure     Embrace multi-stakeholder approaches to governance and regulation     Create targeted, risk-calibrated oversight regimes for different     web3 activities     Foster innovation with composability, open source code, and the     power of open communities     Broaden access to the economic benefits of the innovation economy     Unlock the potential of DAOs     Deploy web3 to further sustainability goals     Embrace the role of well-regulated stablecoins in financial     inclusion and innovation     Collaborate with other nations to harmonize standards and regulatory     frameworks     Provide clear, fair tax rules for the reporting of digital assets,     and leverage technical solutions for tax compliance
  This list seems targeted toward the coming regulatory landscape, and could be considered at odds with the original tenants of an organically emergent, decentralised internet. Indeed principles such as 'furthering sustainability goals' seem downright incongruous. The community they claim to wish to support here are openly critical of these major institutional players and their motives, with even more pointed criticisms [coming from outside of the Web3](https://www.profgalloway.com/web3/). This book and lab steer well clear of these companies and their applications.
  Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer of 'Circle' venture capital, said in testimony to a US senate hearing; that Web 1 was 'read', Web 2 was 'read write', and that Web 3 will 'read write own'. The important takeaway here is not so much this oft quoted elevator pitch for Web3, but the fact that legislative bodies now consider this technology a force which they need to be aware of and [potentially contend with](https://a16z.com/2021/12/17/prediction-for-the-new-year-a-web3-midterm/).
  Jeremy Allaire, again of Circle', talks about the recent legislative order in the USA as follows: ["this is a watershed moment for crypto, digital assets, and Web 3, akin to the 1996/1997 whole of government wakeup to the commercial internet. The U.S. seems to be taking on the reality that digital assets represent one of the most significant technologies and infrastructures for the 21st century; it's rewarding to see this from the WH after so many of us have been making the case for 9+ years."] We will see in the following chapters that participation in this new Web3 is contingent on owning cryptocurrencies. [It's estimated](https://www.finder.com/uk/cryptocurrency-statistics) that about 6% of people in the UK own some cryptocurrency, with skews to both younger demographics, and smaller holdings. The legislative landscape in the UK is comparatively strict with [questionable](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/perverse-impacts-anti-money-laundering-144239343.html) "know your customer / anti money laundering" (KYC/AML) data collection [mandated in law](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/money-laundering-regulations-your-responsibilities). Users of UK exchanges must provide a great deal of personal financial information, and undertake to prove that the wallets they are withdrawing to are their own. From the perspective of the UK SME it seems this seriously limits the potential audience for new products. Europe meanwhile has recently voted through even more restrictive regulation, applying the "[transfer of funds regulation](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/legislative-train/theme-an-economy-that-works-for-people/file-revision-of-the-regulation-on-transfers-of-funds)" to all transactions coming out of exchanges, enforcing a database of all addresses between companies, and reporting transactions above 1000 Euros to authorities. They have narrowly avoided enforcing KYC on all transfers to private wallets, but have capped transactions at 1000 Euros. The recent ["Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA)](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/06/30/digital-finance-agreement-reached-on-european-crypto-assets-regulation-mica/) legislation imposes overheads that may make it harder for smaller businesses in the sector to operate within the EU, but is has been cautiously welcomed by established players (Figure [2.5](https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#Ch2.F5 "Figure 2.5 ‣ 2.3.1 Emerging consensus ‣ 2.3 Web3 ‣ Chapter 2 Decentralisation & The Web ‣ Part I State of the art"), who have been hungry for clarity. It is certainly far short of the 'ban' seen in China, and the regulation be enforcement in the USA.
  ![Figure 2.5: ["Regulatory clarity attracts capital & entrepreneurs from around the world."](https://twitter.com/paddi_hansen/status/1655883224726241281)](../assets/../assets/pitchbook.jpg)
    European Parliament approved EU's crypto assets framework, MiCA     Enforcement clock starts in June, with 12-18 months for rules to     kick in     MiCA offers licence tailored to crypto asset services and stablecoin     issuers     Regulation refrains from covering decentralized finance or     non-fungible tokens     Stablecoin issuer rules boost consumer confidence, potentially     increasing institutional comfort     Transfer of Funds regulation passed, imposing stronger surveillance     and identification requirements for crypto operators     Regulations described as world-first and end of Wild West era for     crypto assets     MiCA represents a crucial step forward for crypto industry,     providing comprehensive set of rules     Crypto firms must be licenced by the EU and comply with money     laundering and terrorism finance safeguards to serve EU customers     Concerns about weakened privacy due to reporting standards in the     name of customer safety and national security     Binance CEO supports MiCA, calling it a pragmatic solution     EU's MiCA could become a global template for international companies     UK, now outside the EU, is setting similar stablecoin and crypto     asset service rules
  Germany is bringing forward legislation allowing the 'tokenisation' of legacy instruments such as stocks, though it's far from clear what the value of this would be, except perhaps lowering risk for custodians. It seems that this EU position has prompted the UK government to seize the potential competitive advantage offered, and there will be more on this later. Japan meanwhile has gone so far as to [make an announcement](https://cointelegraph.com/news/japanese-prime-minister-says-gov-t-investment-in-digital-transformation-will-include-metaverse-nfts) about supporting the technologies at a national level.
  It's a complex evolving narrative, and clearly contradictions are common. Right now there seems little appeal for stepping into Web3. Into the confusion, this book advances a narrow take, and toolset, which might extract some value from the technologies, while maintaining a low barrier to entry.
- #### 2.4 Example applications
  It's handy here to get a feel for what this looks like. These aren't things that this book wishes to contribute to, or even have a firm opinion on, they're just representative of current activity in the decentralised web space.
- ##### 2.4.1 Veilid
	- A Peer-to-Peer Privacy Mesh Project
	  Veilid is an open-source, mobile-first, networked application framework for building decentralized apps with networking, distributed data storage, and built-in IP privacy without reliance on external services.
	  [Platforms] : Runs on Linux, Mac, Windows,     Android, iOS, and in browsers via WASM. Bindings available in Rust,     Dart, and other languages.     [Protocols] : Supports UDP, TCP, WebSockets.     DNS only used briefly during bootstrap.     [Encryption] : Uses Ed25519, XChaCha20, BLAKE3     for end-to-end encryption and authentication.     [Storage] : Distributed hash table for data     records close to node keys. Popular data replicated.     [Routing] : Nodes help each other connect.     Routing based on node IDs. Private routing over encrypted hops.     [Goals] : Enable decentralized apps without     reliance on centralised corporate systems.
	  Key features include strong cryptography, ability to run on a variety of platforms, distributed and replicated data storage, and private routing to provide IP privacy. The decentralized design aims to avoid issues with centralised and corporate controlled systems.
- ##### 2.4.2 Podcasting2.0
  [Podcasting 2.0](https://medium.com/@everywheretrip/an-introduction-to-podcasting-2-0-3c4f61ea17f4) leverages [RSS](https://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification) (the original dissemination system for podcasts) and the Bitcoin Lightning network, to enable so-called '[value for value](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO1aDZ6L4NQ&t=1123s)' broadcasting. Subscribers use one of a variety of apps to stream micro-transactions of Bitcoin directly to the content creators as they listen to the podcast. No intermediate business takes a cut. Some variation on this model exists, such as John Carvalho's crowd funded podcast "The Biz" which progressively unlocks more minutes for everyone based on [crowd funded donations](https://thebiz.pro/about#crowdwall).
- ##### 2.4.3 Crowd funding
- ##### 2.4.4 Distributed exchanges
  There are dozens of decentralised exchanges deployed on various blockchains. These platforms allow users to trade back and forth between various tokens (including 'normal money' stablecoins) and charge a fee for doing so. They operate within the logic of the smart contracts \[[5](https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx5)\], within the distributed blockchains. This makes them extremely hard to ban, and as a result they operate in a legal grey area. At the extreme end of this is "distributed apps" (dApps) and "Decentralised Finance" (DeFi) which allows users access to complex financial instruments without legal or privacy constraints. DeFi will be touched on briefly later.
  This is a huge area, and of only limited interest to the topics expanded in this book. It's perhaps worth noting [BitcoinDEX](https://bitcoin-dex.net/about/index.html), which runs in JavaScript in a web browser. It is effectively uncensorable, [auditable by the user](https://bitcoin-dex.net/tokens.js), and has no counter party risk since it operates entirely in the Bitcoin network. It is clearly an early prototype but manages this complex feature without the more expressive logic of more 'modern' public blockchains.
- ##### 2.4.5 NFT marketplaces
  NFT markets are far more centralised services which match 'owners' of digital assets with potential buyers. The concept is a staple of the more recent interpretation of Web3, even though in practice these seem to be centralised concerns. [Opensea](https://opensea.io/) claims to be the largest decentralised NFT marketplace, but they have the ability to [remove listings](https://thedefiant.io/sad-frogs-delisted-opensea/) in response to legal challenges. This seems to fly in the face of Web3 principles. NFTs are currently a [deeply flawed](https://tante.cc/2021/12/17/the-third-web/) technology but seem likely to persist and will be covered later.
- ##### 2.4.6 Non blockchain webs of trust
  New products like pubky and Nostr (covered later) use a web of trust decentralised peer-to-peer (ish) model which assigns metadata and trust scores to 'any' data and connection, with a security model rooted in the Bitcoin cryptographic 'keys' but crucially not the bitcoin network. This makes it interoperable with bitcoin but not reliant upon it. In principle this allows users to build complex networks of inherited trust bi-directionally with their networks over time. Every connection to a peer can be a new schema, with individual metadata managed by the user. These are new and have low adoption at this time. The user controls the source of the data and can allow them to be used by centralised services. This flips the authentication and data management paradigm of web around, putting the user in charge of their data. This is a familiar concept to the DID/SSI communities (described later) but with significant investment. As pubky and Nostr use keys as endpoints they act as a web of naming and routing, bypassing the existing web infrastructure of DNS. It is likely very complex to use in practice and will be revisited later. pubky is being paired with the [Hypercore protocol](https://hypercore-protocol.org/) for peer-to-peer data sharing, more specifically the 'hole punching' capability of the hypercore system which ensures connections through firewalls\[[6](https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx6)\]. The first application by the affiliated Hyperdivision team is an open source peer-to-peer live video streaming app called [Dazaar](https://dazaar.com/). Once again, it's not clear yet who wants or needs this bit-torrent style service.
- ##### 2.4.7 Distributed DNS applications
  There are many perceived problems with having centralised authorities for overseeing the database which translates between human readable internet names and the underlying machine-readable address notation. The databases which manage this globally are already somewhat distributed, and this distributed trust model is managed through a cryptographic chain of trust called DNSSEC which is capped by a somewhat [bizarre key ceremony](https://www.iana.org/dnssec/ceremonies) seen in Figure [2.6](https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#Ch2.F6 "Figure 2.6 ‣ 2.4.7 Distributed DNS applications ‣ 2.4 Example applications ‣ Chapter 2 Decentralisation & The Web ‣ Part I State of the art"). The authority around naming is centralised in ICANN.
  ![Figure 2.6: [DNSSEC ceremony in a faraday cage](https://www.internetsociety.org/blog/2016/10/watch-live-today-dnssec-root-ksk-ceremony-at-1700-utc/)](../assets/dnssec.jpg) There has been talk for many years about 'properly' distributing this database using decentralised/blockchain technologies\[[7](https://arxiv.org/html/2207.09460v11/#bib.bibx7)\]. The nature of this problem means that it either moves from control by ICANN, or it does not, and so far it has not, but there are many attempted, and somewhat mature attempts, at this difficult problem. Of these [Namecoin](https://www.namecoin.org/) is the most prominent, and is a fork of Bitcoin. The ubiquity of Bitcoin in such systems is perhaps becoming apparent.
- ##### 2.4.8 Impervious browser
  It might be that the future of Web3 comes in the guise of integrated suites such as the proposed [Impervious web browser](https://newsletter.impervious.ai/impervious-browser-functionality-overview/). They say that "without centralised intermediaries" it features:
    Google Docs, without Google.     WhatsApp, without WhatsApp.     Identity, without the state.
  This is obviously leading marketing hype, and they're already late for their release deadline, but what they're talking about here is an integration of the components mentioned in this book. If they can get critical mass around this browser then perhaps the Web3 market can be kickstarted. CEO Chase Perkins has [recently presented](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2J8v-TMygK8) on this.
- ## Web 4.0
  The EU has released it's [positional thinking](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_3718) on Web 4. This has come pretty much out of nowhere but seems highly relevant to us if it sticks. From the text: Here is the bullet point list in LaTeX:
	- [Empowering people and reinforcing skills]  to     foster awareness, access to trustworthy information and build a     talent pool of virtual world specialists. By the end of 2023, the     Commission will promote the guiding principles for virtual worlds,     put forward by the Citizens' Panel; and will develop guidance for     the general public thanks to a 'Citizen toolbox' by the first     quarter of 2024. As specialists on virtual worlds are essential, the     Commission will work with Member States to set up a talent pipeline     and will support skills development, including for women and girls,     through projects funded by the Digital Europe Programme, and for     creators of digital content through the Creative Europe programme.     [Business: supporting a European Web 4.0 industrial     ecosystem]  to scale up excellence and address     fragmentation. Currently, there is no EU ecosystem bringing together     the different players of the value chain of virtual worlds and Web     4.0. The Commission has proposed a candidate Partnership on Virtual     Worlds under Horizon Europe, possibly starting 2025, to foster     excellence in research and develop an industrial and technological     roadmap for virtual worlds. To foster innovation, the Commission     will also support EU creators and media companies to test new     creation tools, bring together developers and industrial users, and     work with Member States to develop regulatory sandboxes for Web 4.0     and virtual worlds.     [Government: supporting societal progress and virtual public     services]  to leverage the opportunities     virtual worlds can offer. The EU is already investing in major     initiatives, such as Destination Earth (DestinE), Local Digital     Twins for smart communities, or the European Digital Twin of the     Ocean to allow researchers to advance science, industries to develop     precision applications and public authorities to make informed     public-policy decisions. The Commission is launching two new public     flagships: "CitiVerse", an immersive urban environment that can be     used for city planning and management; and a European Virtual Human     Twin, which will replicate the human body to support clinical     decisions and personal treatment.     [Shaping global standards for open and interoperable virtual worlds     and Web 4.0,]  ensuring that they will not be     dominated by a few big players. The Commission will engage with     internet governance stakeholders around the world and will promote     Web 4.0 standards in line with the EU's vision and values.
- ## The common thread
- Overall then, perhaps the space is hype, and is certainly [rife with scams](https://web3isgoinggreat.com/). Fully 24% of projects in 2022 are [estimated to be built](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-crypto-pump-and-dump-schemes/) as 'pump and dump' scams. The degree to which it even accomplishes decentralised trust is highly debatable, and meanwhile the limited numbers of Web3 and supporting crypto companies display lamentable cyber security practice themselves, creating [honeypots of personal data](https://www.coindesk.com/tag/data-breaches/) from users of the ecosystem.
  With that said the component parts necessary to deliver on the promise [do]  exist. If there is to be no central controlling party(s) as in the Web 2 model then nothing can happen without a cryptographically secure underpinning, allowing digital data to be passed around without a prior arrangement.
  The following chapter will describe how much has been done by computer scientists over the past decades to support that. From this base layer we also get the potential for secure and trust minimised identity management. This nascent field of distributed identity management is explained later. From distributed trust models we can see 'trustless' transmission of economic value. The ability to send value from one person to another person or service without a third party.
  This whole area is 'crypto', which is increasingly seeping into the human consciousness, and saw an astonishing \$30B of [capital investment in 2021](https://docsend.com/view/nrvsuae85a4dx3jz) alone. At time of writing the industry is an [over 1 trillion](https://www.coingecko.com/en) dollar market.
  All the new crypto technologies circling the Web3 narrative are bound tightly together, but there is currently very little meaningful value to be seen.
  The rest of this book will focus on the trust and value transfer elements of this shift in internet technologies, and attempt to build a case for it's use in decentralised, open source, collaborative mixed reality applications.

	- Of their 2022 ‘Big Ideas’ report, ARK investment LLC (who manage a $50B tech investment) said the following, which connects some of the dots already mentioned “While many (with heavily vested interests) want to define all things blockchain as web3 we believe that web3 is best understood as just 1 of 3 revolutions that the innovation of bitcoin has catalysed.
		- The Money Revolution
		- The Financial Revolution
		- The Internet Revolution”
- This new hyped push for Web3 is being driven by enormous venture capital investment. A16Z are a major player in this new landscape and have released their ten principles for emergent Web3. Note here that A16Z are (like so many others) probably a house of cards.
	- Establish a clear vision to foster decentralized digital infrastructure
	- Embrace multi-stakeholder approaches to governance and regulation
	- Create targeted, risk-calibrated oversight regimes for different web3 activities
	- Foster innovation with composability, open source code, and the power of open communities
	- Broaden access to the economic benefits of the innovation economy
	- Unlock the potential of DAOs
	- Deploy web3 to further sustainability goals
	- Embrace the role of well-regulated stablecoins in financial inclusion and innovation
	- Collaborate with other nations to harmonize standards and regulatory frameworks
	- Provide clear, fair tax rules for the reporting of digital assets, and lever­age technical solutions for tax compliance
- This list seems targeted toward the coming regulatory landscape, and could be considered at odds with the original tenants of an organically emergent, decentralised internet. Indeed principles such as ‘furthering sustainability goals’ seem downright incongruous.

The important takeaway here is not so much this oft quoted elevator pitch for Web3, but the fact that legislative bodies now consider this technology a force which they need to be aware of and potentially contend with.
- Jeremy Allaire, again of Circle’, talks about the recent legislative order in the USA as follows: “this is a watershed moment for crypto, digital assets, and Web 3, akin to the 1996/1997 whole of government wakeup to the commercial internet. The U.S. seems to be taking on the reality that digital assets represent one of the most significant technologies and infrastructures for the 21st century; it’s rewarding to see this from the WH after so many of us have been making the case for 9+ years.”
- We see that participation in this new Web3 is contingent on owning cryptocurrencies. It’s estimated that about 6% of people in the UK own some cryptocurrency, with skews to both younger demographics, and smaller holdings.

- ### Semantic web
	- The “semantic web” definition of Web3.0 has been somewhat overhauled byother innovations in decentralised internet technologies, now evolvingtoward the slightly different Web3 moniker. Tim Berners Lee (of WWWfame) first mentioned the semantic web in 1999.[[semanticWeb]]
	- “I have a dream for the Web \[in which computers\] become capable ofanalyzing all the data on the Web – the content, links, and transactionsbetween people and computers. A "Semantic Web", which makes thispossible, has yet to emerge, but when it does, the day-to-day mechanismsof trade, bureaucracy and our daily lives will be handled by machinestalking to machines. The "intelligent agents" people have touted forages will finally materialize.”
	- Attention developed around three core themes, ubiquitous availabilityand searchability of data, intelligent search assistants, and highlyavailable end points such as phones, and ‘internet of things’ devices.This is certainly manifesting in home devices, but few people think ofthis as a Web3 revolution.
	- Since ratification of the standards by the [World Wide Web (W3C)consortium](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/) it seems thattheir imperative toward decentralisation has become lost. Instead, itcan be seen that Facebook, Amazon, Google, and Apple have a harmfuloligopoly on users data.[[costigan2018world]] This is at odds withBerners-Lee’s vision, and he has recently [spoken out about thisdiscrepancy](https://thenextweb.com/news/web-inventor-tim-berners-lee-screw-web3-my-decentralized-internet-doesnt-need-blockchain/),and attempted to [refocus themedia](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/04/web-inventor-tim-berners-lee-wants-us-to-ignore-web3.html)onto Web3.0.
	- It is worth taking a look at his software implementation called[Solid](https://solidproject.org), which is far more mindful of thesovereignty of user data.
	- “Solid is an exciting new project led by Prof. Tim Berners-Lee, inventorof the World Wide Web, taking place at MIT. The project aims toradically change the way Web applications work today, resulting in truedata ownership as well as improved privacy. Solid (derived from "sociallinked data") is a proposed set of conventions and tools for buildingdecentralized social applications based on Linked Data principles. Solidis modular and extensible and it relies as much as possible on existingW3C standards and protocols.”
	- Excitement around this kind of differentiated trust model, hinted at inubiquitous availability of data (and implemented explicitly in Solid),has led to exploration of different paths by cryptographers, and thiswill be described later. For instance, one of the main developers ofSolid, [Carvelho](https://github.com/melvincarvalho/), is now a leadingdeveloper and propotent of Nostr, another very interesting option whichwill be described later. This technology space is prolific, but stillcomparatively young and small.
-
	- ### Spatial web
- “The Spatial Web”, a blurring of the boundaries between digital andgeospatial physical objects, seems to have developed from the strands inthe original W3C scope around devices in the real world. It has beenconcentrating around AR and VR but is being marketed and amplified withthe same references to availability of data (See Figure<a href="#fig:deloitteSpatial" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:deloitteSpatial">2.1</a>from a Deloitte accounting report). This too is finding little tractionin practice, though obviously the component technologies continue toenjoy rapid development. Nonetheless, this interpretation of Web3becomes valuable when examining Metaverse later.

-
	- ### Web3
- More recently Web3 is [beingtouted](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=web3) as away to connect content creators directly to content consumers, withoutcentralised companies acting as gatekeepers of the data. It implies thatall users have a cryptographic key management system, to which theyattach metadata, that they make requirements of peers with whom theycommunicate, and that they maintain trust ‘scores’ with peers.
- It seems likely that this new model is less driven by a market need, andmore by the high availability of tools which allow this to happen (theecosystems described later). Add to this a social response to the[collapse in trust of companies such asFacebook](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-facebook-worst-company-of-the-year-yahoo-finance-165345819.html)and other [social mediaplatforms](https://reb00ted.org/tech/20220727-end-of-social-networking/)[[torok2017cascading]](Figure<a href="#fig:trustbarometer" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:trustbarometer">2.2</a>).There is perhaps a wish by consumers to pass more of the economicincentive to content creators, without the ‘rent seeking’ layer affordedby businesses, and a healthy dose of mania driven market speculation.[Edelman’s latest trustreport](https://www.edelman.co.uk/sites/g/files/aatuss301/files/2022-01/2022%20Edelman%20Trust%20Barometer_UK.pdf)is shocking, finding that trust in all institutions has slumped recentlyto all time lows, and their global survey found that: it“Nearly 6 in 10say their default tendency is to distrust something until they seeevidence it is trustworthy. Another 64% say it’s now to a point wherepeople are incapable of having constructive and civil debates aboutissues they disagree on. When distrust is the default – we lack theability to debate or collaborate.”

	- #### Emerging consensus
- The recent hype cycle ignored the legacy definitions described above andinstead focusing almost exclusively on Ethereum based peer-to-peerprojects. It can be seen that the description is somewhat in the eye ofthe beholder.
- It’s possible to frame this Ethereum Web3 as a hugely complex andinefficient digital rights management system (DRM). DRM is somethingthat users of the internet are increasingly familiar and comfortablewith. It’s somewhat debatable whether decentralising this is worthwhile.The thesis of the developers of the technology seems to be that withoutit, control of ‘value’ will accrete over time, to one or more hegemoniccontrolling entities. It’s a strong argument, but there is a[substantial counterargument](https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html)emerging that users just don’t want this stuff. The nervousness oflegislators in the USA to the attempt by Facebook/Meta to enter thispeer-to-peer value transmission space is telling in terms of theperception of who is driving Web3.
- Throughout 2022 there was much furore on the internet over what Web3might be, and who it ‘serves’. Enthusiasts feel that products such as[Sign-In withEthereum](https://blog.spruceid.com/sign-in-with-ethereum-is-a-game-changer-part-1/)(EIP-4361) might give users choice over their data sovereignty, and ameme to this effect is seen in Figure<a href="#fig:web1web2web3" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:web1web2web3">2.3</a>.In practice though users are expecting to use badly written, buggy,economically vulnerable ‘crypto’ wallets to log into websites. Thequality of this wallet software is improving of late with the so called“wallet wars” seeing commerce grade offerings from Coinbase and sharesplatform ‘Robinhood’. These two companies alone have over 100 millionusers. It’s likely that these wallets will evolve to offer the fullspectrum of Web3 functionality. With that said it doesn’t seem to makemuch sense yet on the face of it. There are in fact examples of thetechnology completely failing at censorship resistance. Popular ‘Web3’browser extension Metamask and NFT platform Opensea have both [recentlybannedcountries](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2022/03/03/iranian-venezuela-users-abruptly-dropped-from-major-crypto-platforms-as-russian-sanctions-grow/?sh=22bcabc470b0)in response to global sanction pressure. This failure to meaningfullydecentralise will be explored further in the distributed identitysection.

- This new hyped push for Web3 is being driven by enormous venture capitalinvestment. A16Z are a [majorplayer](https://a16z.com/2022/01/07/9b-to-build-the-future/) in this newlandscape and have released their [tenprinciples](https://a16z.com/2022/01/07/how-to-build-a-better-internet-10-principles-for-world-leaders-shaping-the-future-of-web3/)for emergent Web3. Note here that A16Z are (like so many others)probably a [house ofcards](https://twitter.com/coryklippsten/status/1592242420137148416).
-
	- Establish a clear vision to foster decentralized digital infrastructure
-
	- Embrace multi-stakeholder approaches to governance and regulation
-
	- Create targeted, risk-calibrated oversight regimes for different web3 activities
-
	- Foster innovation with composability, open source code, and the power of open communities
-
	- Broaden access to the economic benefits of the innovation economy
-
	- Unlock the potential of DAOs
-
	- Deploy web3 to further sustainability goals
-
	- Embrace the role of well-regulated stablecoins in financial inclusion and innovation
-
	- Collaborate with other nations to harmonize standards and regulatory frameworks
-
	- Provide clear, fair tax rules for the reporting of digital assets, and leverage technical solutions for tax compliance
- This list seems targeted toward the coming regulatory landscape, andcould be considered at odds with the original tenants of an organicallyemergent, decentralised internet. Indeed principles such as ‘furtheringsustainability goals’ seem downright incongruous. The community theyclaim to wish to support here are openly critical of these majorinstitutional players and their motives, with even more pointedcriticisms [coming from outside of theWeb3](https://www.profgalloway.com/web3/). This book and lab steer wellclear of these companies and their applications.
- Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer of ‘Circle’ venture capital, saidin testimony to a US senate hearing; that Web 1 was ‘read’, Web 2 was‘read write’, and that Web 3 will ‘read write own’. The importanttakeaway here is not so much this oft quoted elevator pitch for Web3,but the fact that legislative bodies now consider this technology aforce which they need to be aware of and [potentially contendwith](https://a16z.com/2021/12/17/prediction-for-the-new-year-a-web3-midterm/).
- Jeremy Allaire, again of Circle’, talks about the recent legislativeorder in the USA as follows: it“this is a watershed moment for crypto,digital assets, and Web 3, akin to the 1996/1997 whole of governmentwakeup to the commercial internet. The U.S. seems to be taking on thereality that digital assets represent one of the most significanttechnologies and infrastructures for the 21st century; it’s rewarding tosee this from the WH after so many of us have been making the case for9+ years.”
- We will see in the following chapters that participation in this newWeb3 is contingent on owning cryptocurrencies. [It’sestimated](https://www.finder.com/uk/cryptocurrency-statistics) thatabout 6% of people in the UK own some cryptocurrency, with skews to bothyounger demographics, and smaller holdings. The legislative landscape inthe UK is comparatively strict with[questionable](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/perverse-impacts-anti-money-laundering-144239343.html)“know your customer / anti money laundering” (KYC/AML) data collection[mandated inlaw](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/money-laundering-regulations-your-responsibilities).Users of UK exchanges must provide a great deal of personal financialinformation, and undertake to prove that the wallets they arewithdrawing to are their own. From the perspective of the UK SME itseems this seriously limits the potential audience for new products.Europe meanwhile has recently voted through even more restrictiveregulation, applying the “[transfer of fundsregulation](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/legislative-train/theme-an-economy-that-works-for-people/file-revision-of-the-regulation-on-transfers-of-funds)”to all transactions coming out of exchanges, enforcing a database of alladdresses between companies, and reporting transactions above 1000 Eurosto authorities. They have narrowly avoided enforcing KYC on alltransfers to private wallets, but have capped transactions at 1000Euros. The recent [“Markets in Crypto Assets(MiCA)](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/06/30/digital-finance-agreement-reached-on-european-crypto-assets-regulation-mica/)legislation imposes overheads that may make it harder for smallerbusinesses in the sector to operate within the EU, but is has beencautiously welcomed by established players (Figure<a href="#fig:pitchbook" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:pitchbook">2.5</a>,who have been hungry for clarity. It is certainly far short of the ‘ban’seen in China, and the regulation be enforcement in the USA.
- <figure><img src="./assets/3d994af6701b755025ece23c3068daeaaedc1f06.jpg" id="fig:pitchbook" alt="" /><figcaption><a href="https://twitter.com/paddi_hansen/status/1655883224726241281">“Regulatory clarity attracts capital &amp; entrepreneurs from around the world.”</a></figcaption></figure>
-
	- European Parliament approved EU’s crypto assets framework, MiCA
-
	- Enforcement clock starts in June, with 12-18 months for rules to kick in
-
	- MiCA offers licence tailored to crypto asset services and stablecoin issuers
-
	- Regulation refrains from covering decentralized finance or non-fungible tokens
-
	- Stablecoin issuer rules boost consumer confidence, potentially increasing institutional comfort
-
	- Transfer of Funds regulation passed, imposing stronger surveillance and identification requirements for crypto operators
-
	- Regulations described as world-first and end of Wild West era for crypto assets
-
	- MiCA represents a crucial step forward for crypto industry, providing comprehensive set of rules
-
	- Crypto firms must be licenced by the EU and comply with money laundering and terrorism finance safeguards to serve EU customers
-
	- Concerns about weakened privacy due to reporting standards in the name of customer safety and national security
-
	- Binance CEO supports MiCA, calling it a pragmatic solution
-
	- EU’s MiCA could become a global template for international companies
-
	- UK, now outside the EU, is setting similar stablecoin and crypto asset service rules
- Germany is bringing forward legislation allowing the ‘tokenisation’ oflegacy instruments such as stocks, though it’s far from clear what thevalue of this would be, except perhaps lowering risk for custodians. Itseems that this EU position has prompted the UK government to seize thepotential competitive advantage offered, and there will be more on thislater. Japan meanwhile has gone so far as to [make anannouncement](https://cointelegraph.com/news/japanese-prime-minister-says-gov-t-investment-in-digital-transformation-will-include-metaverse-nfts)about supporting the technologies at a national level.
- It’s a complex evolving narrative, and clearly contradictions arecommon. Right now there seems little appeal for stepping into Web3. Intothe confusion, this book advances a narrow take, and toolset, whichmight extract some value from the technologies, while maintaining a lowbarrier to entry.
-
	- ### Example applications
- It’s handy here to get a feel for what this looks like. These aren’tthings that this book wishes to contribute to, or even have a firmopinion on, they’re just representative of current activity in thedecentralised web space.
-
	- #### Veilid
	- A Peer-to-Peer Privacy Mesh Project
- Veilid is an open-source, mobile-first, networked application frameworkfor building decentralized apps with networking, distributed datastorage, and built-in IP privacy without reliance on external services.
-
	- **Platforms**: Runs on Linux, Mac, Windows, Android, iOS, and in browsers via WASM. Bindings available in Rust, Dart, and other languages.
-
	- **Protocols**: Supports UDP, TCP, WebSockets. DNS only used briefly during bootstrap.
-
	- **Encryption**: Uses Ed25519, XChaCha20, BLAKE3 for end-to-end encryption and authentication.
-
	- **Storage**: Distributed hash table for data records close to node keys. Popular data replicated.
-
	- **Routing**: Nodes help each other connect. Routing based on node IDs. Private routing over encrypted hops.
-
	- **Goals**: Enable decentralized apps without reliance on centralised corporate systems.
- Key features include strong cryptography, ability to run on a variety ofplatforms, distributed and replicated data storage, and private routingto provide IP privacy. The decentralized design aims to avoid issueswith centralised and corporate controlled systems.
-
	- #### Podcasting2.0
- [Podcasting2.0](https://medium.com/@everywheretrip/an-introduction-to-podcasting-2-0-3c4f61ea17f4)leverages [RSS](https://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification) (theoriginal dissemination system for podcasts) and the Bitcoin Lightningnetwork, to enable so-called ‘[value forvalue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO1aDZ6L4NQ&t=1123s)’broadcasting. Subscribers use one of a variety of apps to streammicro-transactions of Bitcoin directly to the content creators as theylisten to the podcast. No intermediate business takes a cut. Somevariation on this model exists, such as John Carvalho’s crowd fundedpodcast “The Biz” which progressively unlocks more minutes for everyonebased on [crowd funded donations](https://thebiz.pro/about#crowdwall).
-
	- #### Crowd funding
- At time of writing a [crowd fundinginitiative](https://www.constitutiondao.com/) based around a digitaldecentralised construct called a DAO (explained later in detail)[managed to raise $46 million dollars to bid for a copy of the USconstitution](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/12/06/daos-and-the-next-crowdfunding-gold-rush/)at Southerbys auction house. The attempt narrowly failed, but the press[heralded this new era of “Web3” economicmight](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/12/09/what-kickstarter-going-decentralized-means-for-web-3/).This model might be the only use for DAOs and is likely just a way toavoid regulatory scrutiny. There is more detail on DAOs later.
-
	- #### Distributed exchanges
- There are dozens of decentralised exchanges deployed on variousblockchains. These platforms allow users to trade back and forth betweenvarious tokens (including ‘normal money’ stablecoins) and charge a feefor doing so. They operate within the logic of the smartcontracts,[[szabo1997formalizing]] within the distributed blockchains.This makes them extremely hard to ban, and as a result they operate in alegal grey area. At the extreme end of this is “distributed apps”(dApps) and “Decentralised Finance” (DeFi) which allows users access tocomplex financial instruments without legal or privacy constraints. DeFiwill be touched on briefly later.
- This is a huge area, and of only limited interest to the topics expandedin this book. It’s perhaps worth noting[BitcoinDEX](https://bitcoin-dex.net/about/index.html), which runs inJavaScript in a web browser. It is effectively uncensorable, [auditableby the user](https://bitcoin-dex.net/tokens.js), and has no counterparty risk since it operates entirely in the Bitcoin network. It isclearly an early prototype but manages this complex feature without themore expressive logic of more ‘modern’ public blockchains.
-
	- #### NFT marketplaces
- NFT markets are far more centralised services which match ‘owners’ ofdigital assets with potential buyers. The concept is a staple of themore recent interpretation of Web3, even though in practice these seemto be centralised concerns. [Opensea](https://opensea.io/) claims to bethe largest decentralised NFT marketplace, but they have the ability to[remove listings](https://thedefiant.io/sad-frogs-delisted-opensea/) inresponse to legal challenges. This seems to fly in the face of Web3principles. NFTs are currently a [deeplyflawed](https://tante.cc/2021/12/17/the-third-web/) technology but seemlikely to persist and will be covered later.
-
	- #### Non blockchain webs of trust
- New products like pubky and Nostr (covered later) use a web of trustdecentralised peer-to-peer (ish) model which assigns metadata and trustscores to ‘any’ data and connection, with a security model rooted in theBitcoin cryptographic ‘keys’ but crucially not the bitcoin network. Thismakes it interoperable with bitcoin but not reliant upon it. Inprinciple this allows users to build complex networks of inherited trustbi-directionally with their networks over time. Every connection to apeer can be a new schema, with individual metadata managed by the user.These are new and have low adoption at this time. The user controls thesource of the data and can allow them to be used by centralisedservices. This flips the authentication and data management paradigm ofweb around, putting the user in charge of their data. This is a familiarconcept to the DID/SSI communities (described later) but withsignificant investment. As pubky and Nostr use keys as endpointsthey act as a web of naming and routing, bypassing the existing webinfrastructure of DNS. It is likely very complex to use in practice andwill be revisited later. pubky is being paired with the [Hypercoreprotocol](https://hypercore-protocol.org/) for peer-to-peer datasharing, more specifically the ‘hole punching’ capability of thehypercore system which ensures connections throughfirewalls[[ford2005peer]]. The first application by the affiliatedHyperdivision team is an open source peer-to-peer live video streamingapp called [Dazaar](https://dazaar.com/). Once again, it’s not clear yetwho wants or needs this bit-torrent style service.
-
	- #### Distributed DNS applications
- There are many perceived problems with having centralised authoritiesfor overseeing the database which translates between human readableinternet names and the underlying machine-readable address notation. Thedatabases which manage this globally are already somewhat distributed,and this distributed trust model is managed through a cryptographicchain of trust called DNSSEC which is capped by a somewhat [bizarre keyceremony](https://www.iana.org/dnssec/ceremonies) seen in Figure<a href="#fig:dnssec" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:dnssec">2.6</a>.The authority around naming is centralised in ICANN.
- <figure><img src="./assets/27d09216a9dc4a6788c3c3d4b796983741349f54.jpg" id="fig:dnssec" alt="" /><figcaption><a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/blog/2016/10/watch-live-today-dnssec-root-ksk-ceremony-at-1700-utc/">DNSSEC ceremony in a faraday cage</a></figcaption></figure>
- There has been talk for many years about ‘properly’ distributing thisdatabase using decentralised/blockchaintechnologies[[karaarslan2018blockchain]]. The nature of this problemmeans that it either moves from control by ICANN, or it does not, and sofar it has not, but there are many attempted, and somewhat matureattempts, at this difficult problem. Of these[Namecoin](https://www.namecoin.org/) is the most prominent, and is afork of Bitcoin. The ubiquity of Bitcoin in such systems is perhapsbecoming apparent.
-
	- #### Impervious browser
- It might be that the future of Web3 comes in the guise of integratedsuites such as the proposed [Impervious webbrowser](https://newsletter.impervious.ai/impervious-browser-functionality-overview/).They say that “without centralised intermediaries” it features:
-
	- Zoom, without Zoom.
-
	- Google Docs, without Google.
-
	- Medium, without Medium.
-
	- WhatsApp, without WhatsApp.
-
	- Payments, without banks.
-
	- Identity, without the state.
- This is obviously leading marketing hype, and they’re already late fortheir release deadline, but what they’re talking about here is anintegration of the components mentioned in this book. If they can getcritical mass around this browser then perhaps the Web3 market can bekickstarted. CEO Chase Perkins has [recentlypresented](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2J8v-TMygK8) on this.
-
	- ### Web 4.0
- The EU has released it’s [positionalthinking](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_3718)on Web 4. This has come pretty much out of nowhere but seems highlyrelevant to us if it sticks. From the text: Here is the bullet pointlist in LaTeX:
-
	- **Empowering people and reinforcing skills** to foster awareness, access to trustworthy information and build a talent pool of virtual world specialists. By the end of 2023, the Commission will promote the guiding principles for virtual worlds, put forward by the Citizens’ Panel; and will develop guidance for the general public thanks to a ‘Citizen toolbox’ by the first quarter of 2024. As specialists on virtual worlds are essential, the Commission will work with Member States to set up a talent pipeline and will support skills development, including for women and girls, through projects funded by the Digital Europe Programme, and for creators of digital content through the Creative Europe programme.
-
	- **Business: supporting a European Web 4.0 industrial ecosystem** to scale up excellence and address fragmentation. Currently, there is no EU ecosystem bringing together the different players of the value chain of virtual worlds and Web 4.0. The Commission has proposed a candidate Partnership on Virtual Worlds under Horizon Europe, possibly starting 2025, to foster excellence in research and develop an industrial and technological roadmap for virtual worlds. To foster innovation, the Commission will also support EU creators and media companies to test new creation tools, bring together developers and industrial users, and work with Member States to develop regulatory sandboxes for Web 4.0 and virtual worlds.
-
	- **Government: supporting societal progress and virtual public services** to leverage the opportunities virtual worlds can offer. The EU is already investing in major initiatives, such as Destination Earth (DestinE), Local Digital Twins for smart communities, or the European Digital Twin of the Ocean to allow researchers to advance science, industries to develop precision applications and public authorities to make informed public-policy decisions. The Commission is launching two new public flagships: “CitiVerse”, an immersive urban environment that can be used for city planning and management; and a European Virtual Human Twin, which will replicate the human body to support clinical decisions and personal treatment.
-
	- **Shaping global standards for open and interoperable virtual worlds and Web 4.0,** ensuring that they will not be dominated by a few big players. The Commission will engage with internet governance stakeholders around the world and will promote Web 4.0 standards in line with the EU’s vision and values.
-
	- ### The common thread
- One feature which persists throughout all of these interpretations ofWeb3 is the need for decentralised trust. According to [NathanielWhittemore](https://www.coindesk.com/podcasts/the-breakdown-with-nlw/yesterdays-hearing-was-cryptos-most-positive-interaction-with-the-us-government-ever/),a journalist for Coindesk, “The Web3 moniker positions this industry inopposition to big tech”. Alternatively the [manydetractors](https://cryptocriticscorner.com/) of the technology think itsimply provides avenues for incumbents to experiment with new [models ofcontrol andmonetisation](https://www.cigionline.org/articles/amid-the-hype-over-web3-informed-skepticism-is-critical/),[increasing systemicrisk](https://newsletters.theatlantic.com/galaxy-brain/624cb2ebdc551a00208c1524/crypto-bubble-web3-decentralized-finance/)at no cost to themselves.
- Overall then, perhaps the space is hype, and is certainly [rife withscams](https://web3isgoinggreat.com/). Fully 24% of projects in 2022 are[estimated to bebuilt](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-crypto-pump-and-dump-schemes/)as ‘pump and dump’ scams.

  id:: self-sovereign-identity-about

	- Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) represents a fundamental paradigm shift in digital identity management, transferring control from centralised authorities and federated identity providers to individual users themselves. In traditional identity systems, whether centralised databases maintained by governments and corporations, or federated models like [[OAuth]] and [[SAML]], users remain dependent on third-party organisations to assert, manage, and verify their identities. SSI proposes an alternative architecture where individuals hold cryptographically verifiable credentials in their own [[BC-0459-digital-identity-wallet|digital wallets]], present claims selectively to verifiers, and maintain ultimate authority over their identity data. Built on [[BC-0457-decentralized-identifiers|Decentralised Identifiers]] (DIDs) and [[BC-0458-verifiable-credentials|Verifiable Credentials]], SSI leverages [[BC-0435-hyperledger-indy|Hyperledger Indy]] and other blockchain technologies to create tamper-evident registries without requiring centralised identity databases. The approach addresses critical privacy concerns in an era of ubiquitous digital surveillance, data breaches, and identity theft. Rather than organisations accumulating vast repositories of personal data—prime targets for hackers—SSI distributes identity information to individual holders who reveal only the minimum necessary attributes for each interaction. This principle of selective disclosure, combined with cryptographic proofs, enables users to prove they are over 18 without revealing their exact birthdate, or demonstrate professional qualifications without exposing their complete employment history. The architecture aligns with regulatory frameworks including [[GDPR]], which enshrines rights to data portability and erasure, and is being actively implemented in government programmes from British Columbia's OrgBook containing over 1.4 million legal entities, to the European Union's Self-Sovereign Identity Framework (ESSIF) and emerging European Digital Identity Wallet mandated under eIDAS 2.0 regulation.

	- ### Technical Architecture
		- **Decentralised Identifier Foundation**: SSI systems rely on [[BC-0457-decentralized-identifiers|DIDs]] as persistent, cryptographically verifiable identifiers that individuals and organisations control without requiring centralised registration authorities. Unlike traditional identifiers such as email addresses or usernames tied to specific service providers, DIDs use the format `did:method:identifier` where the method specifies how to resolve the DID to its associated DID Document containing public keys, authentication methods, and service endpoints. The [[Sovrin Network]], built on [[BC-0435-hyperledger-indy|Hyperledger Indy]], implements the `did:sov` method, whilst Microsoft's ION network uses `did:ion` anchored to the [[Bitcoin]] which refers to The first decentralised peer-to-peer electronic cash system and cryptocurrency, implementing proof-of-work consensus, a fixed 21 million coin supply cap, and the UTXO transaction model, serving as the foundational reference implementation for blockchain technology. blockchain via the Sidetree protocol. This decentralisation ensures that identity remains persistent even if specific service providers disappear, addressing the fragility inherent in federated identity systems where account portability depends on continued operation of the identity provider.

		- **Cryptographic Trust Model**: Rather than institutional trust in centralised authorities, SSI establishes trust through public key cryptography and digital signatures. When an issuer such as a university creates a credential certifying a degree, it signs the credential with its private key. The corresponding public key, discoverable through the issuer's DID Document, allows any verifier to cryptographically confirm the credential's authenticity without contacting the issuer. This model dramatically reduces dependency on online verification services, enables offline credential verification in environments with limited connectivity, and prevents issuers from tracking when and where holders present credentials—a significant privacy improvement over centralised systems that log every verification request.

		- **Verifiable Data Registry**: SSI architectures employ various forms of verifiable data registries to anchor cryptographic commitments without storing personal data on-chain. [[BC-0435-hyperledger-indy|Hyperledger Indy]] maintains ledgers recording schemas, credential definitions, revocation registries, and DID Documents, but never the credentials themselves. The [[Sovrin Network]] operates as a permissioned blockchain with steward nodes distributed globally, whilst Microsoft ION uses Bitcoin's blockchain to anchor Sidetree operations containing batches of DID operations compressed and referenced via IPFS hashes. These registries provide tamper-evident records enabling verification of credential validity and revocation status whilst preserving privacy through data minimisation.

		- **Privacy-Preserving Protocols**: Advanced SSI implementations incorporate zero-knowledge proof capabilities enabling selective disclosure and predicate proofs. Using Camenisch-Lysyanskaya (CL) signatures implemented in [[BC-0435-hyperledger-indy|Hyperledger Indy]], credential holders can prove specific attributes (such as age over 18) without revealing the underlying data (their birthdate). Similarly, holders can demonstrate possession of credentials issued by trusted authorities without disclosing other credentials in their wallet. These cryptographic techniques prevent credential correlation across different verifiers—if a user presents a driving licence to rent a car and separately presents an educational credential to apply for a job, the two verifiers cannot collude to link these interactions to the same individual unless the user explicitly chooses to use the same DID for both transactions.

	- ### Core Principles of Self-Sovereignty
		- **Existence**: Users must have an independent existence beyond their digital identities. SSI recognises individuals as sovereign entities with inherent rights preceding any digital representation, establishing that identity systems serve people rather than people serving systems.

		- **Control**: Users must control their identities without depending on external administrative authorities. This extends beyond mere access rights to encompass the ability to create, update, and retire identifiers, choose which credentials to accept and retain, and determine precisely what information to disclose in each interaction.

		- **Access**: Users must have ready access to their own identity data and complete records of how that data has been used. SSI wallets maintain audit logs of credential issuance and presentation events, empowering users with transparency about their digital footprint whilst preventing identity providers from surveilling user activities.

		- **Transparency**: Systems and algorithms governing identity must be open and transparent. The open-source nature of platforms like [[BC-0435-hyperledger-indy|Hyperledger Indy]], along with public governance frameworks published by the [[Sovrin Network]] and [[Trust Over IP Foundation]], ensures that cryptographic methods, data models, and operational policies remain subject to public scrutiny rather than proprietary black boxes.

		- **Persistence**: Identities must remain available for as long as users require them, not subject to arbitrary expiration imposed by service providers. While specific credentials may expire (such as annual professional certifications), the underlying DIDs persist under user control, ensuring continuity of digital existence independent of any organisation's business decisions.

		- **Portability**: Identity information and credentials must be portable across contexts and service providers. Users should export their complete credential collection from one [[BC-0459-digital-identity-wallet|digital wallet]] and import it into another without loss of functionality, preventing vendor lock-in and ensuring competition in the identity service provider ecosystem.

		- **Interoperability**: Identities should be usable across widest possible contexts through adherence to open standards. [[W3C]] specifications for DIDs and Verifiable Credentials, combined with interoperability protocols from the [[Trust Over IP Foundation]], enable credentials issued by one implementation to be verified by any compliant verifier regardless of underlying blockchain or database technology.

		- **Consent**: Users must explicitly consent to any use of their identity data, with granular control over each disclosure. Unlike terms-of-service agreements bundling numerous permissions, SSI implements fine-grained consent at each credential presentation, with cryptographic proof of user authorization preventing unauthorised data sharing.

		- **Minimisation**: Identity disclosures should be limited to the minimum information necessary for each specific purpose. Selective disclosure mechanisms and zero-knowledge proofs enable verifiers to obtain only essential attributes, dramatically reducing privacy risks compared to monolithic identity documents revealing comprehensive personal details.

		- **Protection**: Users' rights to their identity data must be protected by those organisations claiming to represent or verify them. This principle imposes obligations on issuers and verifiers to implement appropriate technical and organisational safeguards, align with data protection regulations like [[GDPR]], and avoid practices that undermine user sovereignty such as correlation tracking or undisclosed data retention.

	- ### Standards Landscape
		- **W3C Specifications**: The [[W3C]] Decentralized Identifier (DID) v1.0 specification, published as a Recommendation in July 2022, provides the foundational standard for SSI identifiers, with v1.1 currently in working draft status incorporating refinements based on implementation experience. The [[W3C]] Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2.0, published as a Recommendation in May 2025, defines the data structure, semantics, and proof mechanisms for cryptographically verifiable credentials. Accompanying specifications including Verifiable Credential Data Integrity 1.0, Data Integrity EdDSA and ECDSA Cryptosuites, and Bitstring Status List v1.0 provide comprehensive technical infrastructure for SSI implementations.

		- **Trust Over IP Stack**: The [[Trust Over IP Foundation]], launched in May 2020 with 27 founding members and hosted by the Linux Foundation, defines a four-layer architecture combining technical and governance stacks. Layer One establishes decentralised trust roots using DIDs, Layer Two implements DIDComm protocol for secure peer-to-peer communication, Layer Three specifies credential exchange protocols based on [[W3C]] Verifiable Credentials, and Layer Four defines governance frameworks describing business, legal, and technical policies. This dual-stack approach recognises that technology alone cannot achieve interoperable digital trust—governance frameworks establishing accountability and dispute resolution mechanisms are equally essential.

		- **European Frameworks**: The European Self-Sovereign Identity Framework (ESSIF), launched in 2019 as part of the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI), provides an eIDAS-compatible SSI architecture for cross-border public services across EU member states. The eIDAS 2.0 Regulation (EU 2024/1183), which entered into force in May 2024, mandates that all EU member states provide certified European Digital Identity Wallets to citizens and businesses by November 2026, with a target of 80% citizen availability by 2030. These wallets must support [[BC-0458-verifiable-credentials|Verifiable Credentials]], enable selective disclosure, and interoperate across jurisdictions whilst complying with strict privacy and security requirements. Over 350 companies and public authorities across 26 member states plus Norway, Iceland, and Ukraine participate in large-scale pilots testing these systems.

		- **Governance Frameworks**: The [[Sovrin Network]] pioneered comprehensive governance approaches with its Sovrin Governance Framework defining roles, responsibilities, and policies for network stewards, transaction endorsers, credential issuers, and other participants. The [[Trust Over IP Foundation]] has published metamodel specifications for describing trust frameworks in machine-readable formats, enabling automated policy enforcement and interoperability assessment. These frameworks address critical questions beyond technical protocols: who is liable when credentials contain errors? How are disputes resolved? What recourse exists if wallets are compromised? Effective SSI deployment requires answers embedded in legally binding governance structures.

	- ### Real-World Implementations
		- **British Columbia OrgBook**: The Government of British Columbia deployed one of the world's first production SSI systems using [[BC-0435-hyperledger-indy|Hyperledger Indy]] and the [[Sovrin Network]]. OrgBook BC provides a searchable public directory of verifiable credentials for registered organisations, containing over 1.4 million active legal entities and 3.8 million verifiable credentials as of 2021. Built on Hyperledger Aries Verifiable Credentials Registry architecture, the system enables government agencies to issue foundational credentials (business registrations, permits, licences) that organisations hold in digital wallets and present to other agencies or private sector verifiers. This eliminates redundant identity verification across different government services, dramatically reducing administrative burden. The system demonstrates SSI's capability to scale to jurisdictional levels whilst maintaining privacy—the public OrgBook contains only public business information, whilst private credentials for sensitive data remain under organisational control in their respective wallets.

		- **Sovrin Network Deployments**: The [[Sovrin Network]], a permissioned blockchain purpose-built for SSI on [[BC-0435-hyperledger-indy|Hyperledger Indy]], supports numerous production use cases across identity proofing, educational credentials, professional certifications, and supply chain verifications. The network's distributed steward nodes, operated by organisations globally under the Sovrin Governance Framework, provide decentralised infrastructure without relying on any single jurisdiction or corporate entity. Integration with the European Self-Sovereign Identity Consortium (ESSIC) enables interoperability between Sovrin-based systems and European EBSI infrastructure, demonstrating the network-of-networks approach essential for global SSI adoption.

		- **European Digital Identity Initiatives**: Countries including Germany, Portugal, Poland, and Austria have commenced issuing digital identity wallets to citizens following eIDAS 2.0 mandate timelines, with production deployments beginning in 2025. These implementations must support use cases spanning government services (tax filing, social benefits applications), private sector transactions (bank account opening, mobile phone contracts), and cross-border scenarios (presenting educational credentials obtained in one country to employers in another). The scale of ambition—wallets for 80% of EU citizens by 2030—represents the largest SSI deployment globally, with technical specifications developed through multi-stakeholder collaboration documented in the EU Digital Identity Wallet Architecture and Reference Framework.

		- **Educational Credentials**: Universities and credentialing organisations increasingly issue [[BC-0458-verifiable-credentials|Verifiable Credentials]] for degrees, transcripts, and micro-credentials. The Blockcerts standard, now aligned with [[W3C]] specifications, enables institutions to issue tamper-evident credentials anchored to [[Bitcoin]] which refers to The first decentralised peer-to-peer electronic cash system and cryptocurrency, implementing proof-of-work consensus, a fixed 21 million coin supply cap, and the UTXO transaction model, serving as the foundational reference implementation for blockchain technology. or [[Ethereum]] which refers to A component of the metaverse ecosystem focusing on ethereum. blockchains. The European Blockchain Services Infrastructure supports the European Student Card initiative enabling students to prove enrollment status, completed courses, and earned qualifications across member states without requiring centralised databases duplicating sensitive educational records. These implementations address credential fraud—estimated to cost the education sector billions annually—whilst empowering learners with portable, verifiable proof of achievements.

	- ### Privacy and Security
		- **Selective Disclosure Mechanisms**: Unlike traditional credentials like passports revealing comprehensive personal information whenever presented, SSI enables fine-grained disclosure control. Using zero-knowledge proofs and cryptographic commitments, holders prove specific claims (age over 18, residency in a particular country, possession of a professional licence) without revealing underlying data. [[BC-0435-hyperledger-indy|Hyperledger Indy]]'s implementation of Camenisch-Lysyanskaya signatures supports predicates enabling mathematical comparisons (age > 21, credit score > 700) proven cryptographically without disclosing actual values. This capability addresses privacy concerns whilst meeting verifier requirements for risk assessment and regulatory compliance.

		- **Correlation Resistance**: SSI architectures implement techniques preventing different verifiers from colluding to track individuals' activities. Pairwise DIDs—unique identifiers used for each relationship—prevent linking based on DID reuse. Cryptographic blinding when deriving proofs from credentials prevents signature-based correlation. Link secrets (cryptographic blinding factors) known only to the holder prevent issuers from tracking where credentials are presented. These layered protections ensure that even if multiple organisations verify the same individual's credentials, they cannot determine these verifications relate to the same person unless the individual explicitly chooses to enable such correlation.

		- **Key Management and Recovery**: The decentralised nature of SSI places critical importance on cryptographic key management. Loss of private keys controlling DIDs and wallets can result in permanent loss of access to credentials and digital identity. Implementations employ various strategies balancing security and recoverability: social recovery mechanisms requiring threshold numbers of trusted contacts to regenerate keys, secure hardware modules protecting keys from extraction, biometric authentication preventing unauthorised access, and encrypted cloud backups with user-controlled decryption keys. The [[Trust Over IP Foundation]]'s specifications for key management provide guidance on appropriate approaches for different risk contexts, recognising that requirements differ dramatically between consumer applications and high-assurance government or financial services.

		- **Revocation and Status Management**: Effective identity systems must support credential revocation when circumstances change—employees leaving organisations, licences expiring, or credentials issued in error. Traditional PKI revocation lists create privacy risks by enabling issuers to track verification attempts. SSI implementations address this through privacy-preserving revocation registries: [[BC-0435-hyperledger-indy|Hyperledger Indy]]'s cryptographic accumulator allows verifiers to cheque revocation status without revealing which credential is being verified, whilst the [[W3C]] Bitstring Status List v1.0 specification published in 2025 provides efficient status checking for credentials at scale. These mechanisms balance privacy protection with issuers' legitimate need to invalidate compromised or outdated credentials.

	- ### Regulatory Compliance
		- **GDPR Alignment**: SSI architectures align naturally with [[GDPR]] principles including data minimisation, purpose limitation, and user control. The Right to Data Portability (Article 20) maps directly to credential portability across wallets and service providers. The Right to Erasure (Article 17) is addressed through on-chain anchoring of cryptographic hashes rather than personal data—deleting credentials from wallets and removing DID Documents from registries achieves erasure whilst maintaining cryptographic integrity of remaining records. However, tensions exist: GDPR's requirement for identification of data controllers and processors conflicts with fully decentralised architectures where no single entity controls infrastructure. Governance frameworks must clearly delineate roles and responsibilities to ensure accountability whilst preserving decentralisation benefits.

		- **eIDAS 2.0 Compatibility**: The revised eIDAS Regulation explicitly embraces SSI through mandated Digital Identity Wallets supporting [[BC-0458-verifiable-credentials|Verifiable Credentials]] and [[BC-0457-decentralized-identifiers|DIDs]]. The regulation establishes legal recognition of qualified electronic signatures and seals created using wallet-based credentials, elevates privacy protections requiring selective disclosure capabilities, and mandates interoperability across member states. Technical specifications define standardised credential schemas for foundational attributes (legal identity, age, nationality), qualified attributes requiring higher assurance (professional qualifications, health data), and pseudonymous attributes enabling privacy-preserving interactions. Large-scale pilots testing cross-border use cases inform ongoing refinement of technical standards and operational policies.

		- **Know Your Customer (KYC) Integration**: Financial institutions subject to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and KYC regulations require robust identity verification. SSI enables more efficient and privacy-preserving KYC through reusable identity verification credentials: customers undergo identity proofing once with a qualified trust service provider, receive a verifiable credential attesting to verified identity attributes and assurance level, then present this credential to multiple financial institutions without repeating verification processes. This approach reduces friction and cost whilst maintaining regulatory compliance. However, regulatory uncertainty persists regarding liability allocation when institutions rely on third-party issued credentials rather than conducting verification directly. Governance frameworks must clarify responsibilities and establish dispute resolution mechanisms to enable broader adoption.

	- ### Comparison with Traditional Identity Models
		- **Centralised vs Self-Sovereign**: Traditional centralised identity systems concentrate personal data in organisational databases creating single points of failure, attractive targets for attackers, and enabling mass surveillance. SSI distributes identity information to individual wallets, eliminating honeypots of personal data whilst empowering users with control. However, centralisation offers simpler operational models with clear accountability structures and established legal frameworks, whereas SSI requires new governance approaches and user assumption of key management responsibilities. The transition path involves hybrid models where SSI complements rather than replaces centralised systems, with credentials anchoring to trusted issuers whilst storage and presentation shift to user control.

		- **Federated vs Self-Sovereign**: Federated identity systems like [[OAuth]], [[SAML]], and OpenID Connect enable single sign-on across multiple service providers by delegating authentication to identity providers (e.g., "Log in with Google"). Whilst improving user experience compared to separate credentials for each service, federation creates dependencies on identity providers, enables tracking of user activity across services, and limits interoperability to pre-established trust relationships. SSI eliminates reliance on online identity provider availability, prevents tracking through pairwise DIDs and unlinkable presentations, and enables credential acceptance based on cryptographic verification rather than bilateral agreements. However, federation offers simpler integration for existing web services, whereas SSI requires wallet software deployment and new verification logic implementation.

		- **Migration Challenges**: Transitioning from established centralised and federated systems to SSI presents significant challenges. Existing identity infrastructure represents substantial sunk investment with operational processes, compliance frameworks, and user expectations built around current models. SSI adoption requires coordination across issuers, holders, and verifiers—the classic chicken-and-egg problem where users won't adopt wallets without useful credentials, issuers won't create credentials without wallet adoption, and verifiers won't accept credentials without established trust frameworks. Successful deployment strategies focus on use cases offering clear value propositions independent of network effects (such as educational credentials providing immediate benefit to holders) and on anchoring new SSI credentials to existing trusted authorities to leverage established institutional trust.

	- ### Challenges and Adoption Barriers
		- **Technical Complexity**: SSI introduces cryptographic concepts, distributed systems architecture, and new verification protocols unfamiliar to most developers and system administrators. Whilst frameworks like [[BC-0435-hyperledger-indy|Hyperledger Aries]] provide higher-level APIs abstracting complexity, integration with existing identity and access management systems requires expertise spanning blockchain, cryptography, and traditional IT infrastructure. The shortage of developers with requisite skills constrains deployment velocity, whilst the pace of standards evolution creates uncertainty about which specifications will achieve lasting adoption.

		- **User Experience**: Effective SSI requires users to understand concepts like private keys, credential schemas, and selective disclosure—abstractions foreign to most people's mental models of identity. Wallet interfaces must hide this complexity behind intuitive experiences matching users' expectations from familiar applications whilst maintaining security properties. Poor user experience in early implementations, particularly around key backup and recovery, has led to loss of credentials and digital identity, creating negative perceptions. Biometric authentication, social recovery mechanisms, and progressive disclosure of advanced features represent evolving approaches to balance usability and security.

		- **Governance Coordination**: Interoperable SSI ecosystems require coordination across multiple stakeholders with divergent interests: governments prioritising regulatory compliance and citizen protection, enterprises seeking efficiency and liability limitation, privacy advocates demanding maximal user control, and technology providers pursuing competitive advantage. Developing governance frameworks balancing these interests whilst maintaining flexibility for innovation presents ongoing challenges. The [[Trust Over IP Foundation]] and similar initiatives provide venues for multi-stakeholder collaboration, but translating consensus into operational reality across jurisdictions with different legal traditions and regulatory approaches remains complex.

		- **Regulatory Uncertainty**: Despite progress through eIDAS 2.0 and other frameworks, significant regulatory uncertainty persists. Questions remain about legal liability when credentials contain errors, enforceability of smart contracts governing credential issuance, applicability of data protection regulations to distributed ledgers, and cross-border recognition of credentials issued under different governance frameworks. This uncertainty deters risk-averse organisations, particularly in heavily regulated sectors like finance and healthcare, from committing to SSI implementations. Regulatory sandboxes enabling controlled experimentation under supervisory oversight provide mechanisms to address uncertainty through practice whilst building evidentiary basis for permanent frameworks.

	- ### Future Directions
		- **Mobile Driving Licences and Government Credentials**: Governments globally are piloting mobile driving licence (mDL) implementations following ISO/IEC 18013-5 standards, with several U.S. states and European countries deploying production systems. Integration with SSI wallets enables mDLs to serve as foundational credentials proving legal identity, age, and address with high assurance levels suitable for financial services onboarding, governmental service access, and other regulated contexts. Expansion to additional government-issued credentials (passports, national ID cards, residency permits) builds comprehensive digital identity portfolios portable across contexts.

		- **Cross-Border Identity Interoperability**: Current identity systems largely operate within national boundaries, creating friction for international travellers, remote workers, and global digital services. SSI's standards-based approach offers potential for credentials issued in one jurisdiction to be verified and accepted in others, contingent on establishment of mutual recognition frameworks. The eIDAS 2.0 requirement for wallet interoperability across EU member states provides large-scale testing ground, whilst bilateral agreements between EU and partner jurisdictions (potentially including post-Brexit UK, United States, and others) could extend interoperability globally. Technical standards are necessary but insufficient—political will and diplomatic coordination to align governance frameworks remain critical.

		- **Internet of Things and Machine Identity**: As IoT devices proliferate, secure device identity and authentication become critical. SSI principles apply equally to autonomous devices, industrial equipment, and AI agents requiring verifiable identity separate from human operators. DIDs enable devices to establish cryptographically verifiable identities, receive authorisation credentials defining permitted actions, and prove provenance and configuration integrity. Applications span autonomous vehicles proving regulatory compliance, medical devices demonstrating safety certifications, and smart city infrastructure authenticating to municipal systems. Scalability challenges intensify with potentially billions of devices requiring identity management at a scale unprecedented in human-centric systems.

		- **AI and Synthetic Identity**: The emergence of capable AI systems and proliferation of deepfakes create urgent need for distinguishing authentic human-generated content and interactions from synthetic productions. Verifiable credentials cryptographically binding content to verified human creators offer potential countermeasure to synthetic identity fraud and misinformation. However, privacy tensions arise—whilst attribution deters malicious synthetic content, mandatory identity disclosure could chill legitimate anonymous speech. Governance frameworks must balance authenticity verification, privacy protection, and free expression through context-appropriate disclosure requirements and technical privacy-enhancing mechanisms like zero-knowledge proofs of credential possession without identity revelation.

2. Will regulators embrace or strangle innovation?
3. Can [[DAOs]] truly govern complex protocols long-term?
4. Will Bitcoin or Ethereum vision of Web3 prevail?
5. Is blockchain necessary for decentralization, or are simpler protocols (Nostr) sufficient?
6. How to balance privacy with regulatory compliance (AML/KYC)?
7. Can Web3 avoid replicating Web2 power structures?

### Existential Risks
- **Quantum computing**: Breaking [[ECDSA]], [[SHA-256]] which refers to Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit (SHA-256) is a cryptographic hash function from the [[SHA-2]] family, designed by the [[NSA]] and published by [[NIST]] in 2001, producing a fixed 256-bit (32-byte) hash value from arbitrary input data. In [[Bitcoin]] and blockchain systems, SHA-256 provides the foundational security mechanism for [[Proof-of-Work]] mining, [[Merkle Tree]] construction, transaction identification, and [[Bitcoin Address]] generation through deterministic, collision-resistant, and preimage-resistant hashing. vulnerabilities
- **Regulatory capture**: Compliance making systems centralised
- **Economic collapse**: Macro downturn, crypto winter, funding drought

- **[[Regenerative Finance]]** (ReFi): Environmental impact tracking

## Historical Context & Evolution

### Early Skepticism (2021-2022)
- More recently [[Web3]] is being touted as a way to connect content creators directly to content consumers, without centralised companies acting as gatekeepers of the data
- It implies that all users have a cryptographic key management system, to which they attach metadata, that they make requirements of peers with whom they communicate, and that they maintain trust 'scores' with peers
- It seems likely that this new model is less driven by a market need, and more by the high availability of tools which allow this to happen (the ecosystems described later)
- Add to this a social response to the collapse in trust of companies such as Facebook and other social media platforms
- There is perhaps a wish by consumers to pass more of the economic incentive to content creators, without the 'rent seeking' layer afforded by businesses, and a healthy dose of mania driven market speculation
- Edelman's latest trust report is shocking, finding that trust in all institutions has slumped recently to all time lows

### The Hype Cycle (2021-2022)
- The recent hype cycle ignored the legacy definitions described above and instead focusing almost exclusively on Ethereum based peer-to-peer projects
- It can be seen that the description is somewhat in the eye of the beholder
- It's possible to frame this Ethereum Web3 as a hugely complex and inefficient digital rights management system ([[DRM]])
- The thesis of the developers of the technology seems to be that without it, control of 'value' will accrete over time, to one or more hegemonic controlling entities
- There is a substantial counter argument emerging that users just don't want this stuff
- The nervousness of legislators in the USA to the attempt by Facebook/Meta to enter this peer-to-peer value transmission space is telling

### Sign-In with Ethereum Evolution
- Throughout 2022 there was much furore on the internet over what Web3 might be, and who it 'serves'
- Enthusiasts feel that products such as [[Sign-In with Ethereum]] ([[EIP-4361]]) might give users choice over their data sovereignty
- In practice though users are expecting to use badly written, buggy, economically vulnerable 'crypto' wallets to log into websites
- The quality of this wallet software is improving of late with the so called "wallet wars" seeing commerce grade offerings from [[Coinbase]] and [[Robinhood]]
- These two companies alone have over 100 million users
- It's likely that these wallets will evolve to offer the full spectrum of Web3 functionality

### Censorship Resistance Failures
- With that said it doesn't seem to make much sense yet on the face of it
- There are in fact examples of the technology completely failing at censorship resistance
- Popular 'Web3' browser extension [[MetaMask]] and NFT platform [[OpenSea]] have both recently banned countries in response to global sanction pressure
- This failure to meaningfully decentralise will be explored further in the distributed identity section

### ARK Investment Perspective (2022)
- Of their 2022 'Big Ideas' report, ARK investment LLC (who manage a $50B tech investment) said the following, which connects some of the dots already mentioned
- "While many (with heavily vested interests) want to define all things blockchain as web3 we believe that web3 is best understood as just 1 of 3 revolutions that the innovation of bitcoin has catalysed:
  - The Money Revolution
  - The Financial Revolution
  - The Internet Revolution"

### Venture Capital Ten Principles
- This new hyped push for Web3 is being driven by enormous venture capital investment
- [[A16Z Crypto]] are a major player in this new landscape and have released their ten principles for emergent Web3
- Note here that A16Z are (like so many others) probably a house of cards
  1. Establish a clear vision to foster decentralized digital infrastructure
  2. Embrace multi-stakeholder approaches to governance and regulation
  3. Create targeted, risk-calibrated oversight regimes for different web3 activities
  4. Foster innovation with composability, open source code, and the power of open communities
  5. Broaden access to the economic benefits of the innovation economy
  6. Unlock the potential of [[DAOs]]
  7. Deploy web3 to further sustainability goals
  8. Embrace the role of well-regulated [[Stablecoins]] in financial inclusion and innovation
  9. Collaborate with other nations to harmonize standards and regulatory frameworks
  10. Provide clear, fair tax rules for the reporting of digital assets, and leverage technical solutions for tax compliance

### Regulatory Recognition (2022)
- This list seems targeted toward the coming regulatory landscape, and could be considered at odds with the original tenants of an organically emergent, decentralised internet
- Indeed principles such as 'furthering sustainability goals' seem downright incongruous
- The community they claim to wish to support here are openly critical of these major institutional players and their motives
- [[Dante Disparte]], chief strategy officer of '[[Circle]]' venture capital, said in testimony to a US senate hearing; that Web 1 was 'read', Web 2 was 'read write', and that Web 3 will 'read write own'
- The important takeaway here is not so much this oft quoted elevator pitch for Web3, but the fact that legislative bodies now consider this technology a force which they need to be aware of and potentially contend with

### 2022 Watershed Moment
- [[Jeremy Allaire]], again of [[Circle]], talks about the recent legislative order in the USA as follows: "this is a watershed moment for crypto, digital assets, and Web 3, akin to the 1996/1997 whole of government wakeup to the commercial internet. The U.S. seems to be taking on the reality that digital assets represent one of the most significant technologies and infrastructures for the 21st century; it's rewarding to see this from the WH after so many of us have been making the case for 9+ years."

### Participation Requirements (2022-2025)
- We see that participation in this new Web3 is contingent on owning cryptocurrencies
- It's estimated that about 6% of people in the UK owned some cryptocurrency in 2022, with skews to both younger demographics, and smaller holdings
- By 2025, this has grown to 12% in the UK, 23% in the US, and 40%+ in emerging markets
