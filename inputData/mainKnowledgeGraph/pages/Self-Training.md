	- definition:: A semi-supervised learning technique where a model is iteratively improved by training on its own high-confidence predictions on unlabelled data. Self-training enables learning from large amounts of unlabelled data by using the model's own predictions as pseudo-labels.

## Academic Context

Self-training demonstrates that models can bootstrap their own performance by leveraging confident predictions on unlabelled data, reducing reliance on expensive labelling.

## Key Characteristics

- Uses model's own predictions
- Iterative improvement
- Semi-supervised learning
- Leverages unlabelled data
- Requires confidence thresholding
- Can amplify biases if not careful
