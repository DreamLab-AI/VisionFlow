  - **Definition**
    - definition:: Decision Transparency represents the degree to which AI system decision-making processes, logic, and rationale are observable, understandable, and accessible to relevant stakeholders including affected individuals, auditors, and regulators. This principle requires AI systems to provide meaningful explanations of automated decisions, disclose the data sources, algorithms, and criteria used in decision-making, and enable verification of decision pathways through audit trails and documentation. Decision transparency encompasses both technical transparency (model architecture, training data, feature importance, algorithmic logic) and organizational transparency (governance frameworks, accountability structures, human oversight mechanisms). In regulatory contexts, decision transparency is mandated by GDPR Article 15 (right to explanation), EU AI Act Article 13 (transparency obligations for high-risk systems), and NIST AI RMF MAP function requirements for documentation and communication. Implementation mechanisms include explainable AI (XAI) techniques such as SHAP values, LIME, attention visualization, and counterfactual explanations, coupled with algorithmic impact assessments, model cards, datasheets, and audit logs. Decision transparency must balance competing requirements for intellectual property protection, security considerations, and meaningful accessibility for non-technical stakeholders while maintaining sufficient detail to enable effective oversight and accountability, as formalized in ISO/IEC 23894:2023 guidelines for AI transparency.
