## Licensing Requirements

Licensing Requirements refers to a component of the blockchain ecosystem.

- Industry adoption of licencing regimes has intensified, with jurisdictions like the UK implementing comprehensive frameworks for crypto businesses.
  - Notable organisations include the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which mandates registration and authorisation for cryptoasset service providers under anti-money laundering (AML) regulations.
  - UK-specific rules, such as the Public Offers and Admissions to Trading (POAT) Regulations 2024 and FCA’s final rules PS25/9 and PS25/10, set clear licencing and promotional standards effective from January 2026.
  - Technical capabilities include identity verification, transaction monitoring, and compliance reporting, though challenges remain in adapting legacy financial regulations to decentralised technologies.
- UK and North England examples:
  - Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield are emerging as innovation hubs where blockchain startups increasingly seek FCA licencing to operate legally.
  - Regional fintech clusters benefit from local regulatory guidance and support, fostering compliance culture alongside technological development.
- Standards and frameworks:
  - The UK’s approach aligns with global trends emphasising AML compliance, consumer protection, and market integrity.
  - Licensing frameworks resemble Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) regimes seen internationally but are tailored to UK-specific legal contexts post-Brexit.

  - The UK’s regulatory framework is designed to attract innovation while ensuring legal certainty for crypto businesses.
- North England innovation hubs:
  - Manchester and Leeds have seen increased blockchain startup activity, supported by local accelerators and regulatory outreach programmes.
  - Newcastle and Sheffield contribute through academic research and pilot projects focusing on compliance technologies and blockchain governance.
- Regional case studies:
  - A Leeds-based fintech recently obtained FCA licencing under the new regime, demonstrating the practical application of licencing requirements in regional contexts.
  - Manchester’s blockchain incubators actively collaborate with regulators to streamline licencing processes for emerging firms.

## Future Directions

- Emerging trends:
  - Expansion of licencing requirements to cover tokenised real-world assets and stablecoins, reflecting evolving market practices.
  - Integration of central bank digital currency (CBDC) considerations into licencing frameworks, pending BoE decisions.
- Anticipated challenges:
  - Balancing regulatory oversight with the inherently decentralised nature of blockchain technologies.
  - Ensuring small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in North England can navigate licencing without prohibitive costs.
- Research priorities:
  - Developing scalable compliance solutions using artificial intelligence.
  - Investigating the socio-economic impact of licencing on regional blockchain ecosystems.
  - Enhancing cross-border regulatory cooperation to reduce fragmentation.
