- ## How it Works
	- AnimateDiff works by adding a motion modelling module to a stable diffusion model. This module is trained on a large dataset of videos and learns to predict the motion between frames. When you provide AnimateDiff with an image and a text prompt, it uses the motion modelling module to generate a sequence of frames that create an animation.
- ## Features
	- **Text-to-Video:** Generate animations from a text prompt and a static image.
	- **Image-to-Video:** Generate animations from a static image.
	- **Video-to-Video:** Transfer the style of one video to another.
	- **ControlNet:** Use ControlNet to guide the animation and create more complex movements.
	- **LoRA:** Use LoRA to fine-tune the model and create specific styles.
