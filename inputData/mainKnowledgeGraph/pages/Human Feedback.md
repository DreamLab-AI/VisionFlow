## Human Feedback

Human Feedback refers to information provided by human evaluators about model outputs, typically in the form of rankings, ratings, demonstrations, or corrections. human feedback serves as the training signal for aligning ai systems with human preferences and values, enabling learning of complex objectives difficult to specify formally.

- Industry adoption of human feedback integration is widespread, especially in large language models, recommendation systems, and safety-critical AI applications.
  - Notable platforms and frameworks facilitating human feedback include LangChain, CrewAI, and vector databases like Pinecone and Weaviate, which support efficient semantic data storage and retrieval.
  - Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) remains a cornerstone technique, training reward models based on human evaluations to fine-tune AI policies for alignment with human values and safety requirements.
- UK and North England examples:
  - Manchester and Leeds host AI research centres focusing on human-centred AI design and ethical alignment, collaborating with industry partners to embed human feedback in AI deployment.
  - Newcastle and Sheffield contribute through interdisciplinary projects combining cognitive science and AI, emphasising user-centric feedback mechanisms in healthcare and public services.
- Technical capabilities:
  - Systems now support multi-turn conversations with memory buffers, real-time sentiment analysis, and predictive analytics to interpret nuanced human input.
  - Limitations include potential bias amplification through feedback loops and challenges in scaling empathetic, context-aware human feedback without losing nuance.
- Standards and frameworks:
  - The EU Artificial Intelligence Act (applicable in the UK context post-Brexit with adaptations) defines AI systems and mandates transparency and human oversight, reinforcing the role of human feedback in responsible AI deployment.
