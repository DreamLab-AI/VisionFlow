## Native Token

Native Token refers to blockchain-native cryptocurrency within blockchain systems, providing essential functionality for distributed ledger technology operations and properties.

- Native tokens remain indispensable across major blockchains such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), Cardano (ADA), and Solana (SOL)
  - They function as the “fuel” for transactions, smart contract execution, and staking activities, maintaining network integrity and decentralisation
  - Prominent platforms continue to evolve native token utility, integrating governance voting, staking rewards, and cross-chain interoperability features
- In the UK, blockchain adoption is growing, with firms and consortia in London and North England (Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, Sheffield) exploring native token applications in finance, supply chain, and digital identity
- Technical capabilities include:
  - Serving as gas for transaction fees and smart contract execution
  - Enabling staking and consensus participation
  - Acting as units of account and stores of value within ecosystems
- Limitations persist in scalability, transaction costs, and energy consumption, though Layer 2 solutions and proof-of-stake mechanisms are mitigating these issues
- Standards such as ERC-20 (for tokens built atop Ethereum) contrast with native tokens, which are integral to their blockchains and not subject to token standards but to protocol rules

  - Environmental impacts and sustainable consensus mechanisms

## UK Context

- The UK has fostered blockchain innovation through regulatory frameworks and research initiatives, with native tokens central to many projects
- North England cities such as Manchester and Leeds host blockchain hubs focusing on fintech, digital identity, and supply chain solutions utilising native tokens for transaction settlement and governance
- Sheffield and Newcastle have emerging communities exploring token-based incentives for smart city infrastructure and energy grids
- British academia contributes to tokenomics and blockchain governance research, with institutions like the University of Manchester and Newcastle University publishing influential work

## Future Directions

- Emerging trends include:
  - Cross-chain native token bridges enhancing liquidity and interoperability
  - Integration of native tokens with real-world assets via tokenisation, blending digital and physical economies
  - Expansion of native token roles in decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs) and Web3 governance
- Anticipated challenges:
  - Balancing scalability with security and decentralisation (the blockchain trilemma)
  - Regulatory clarity, especially regarding token classification and consumer protection in the UK and globally
  - Environmental sustainability of native token consensus mechanisms
- Research priorities focus on:
  - Designing resilient, user-friendly native token economic models
  - Developing standards for native token interoperability
  - Exploring socio-economic impacts of native token adoption in regional economies
