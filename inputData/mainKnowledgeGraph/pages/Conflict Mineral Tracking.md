## Conflict Mineral Tracking

Conflict Mineral Tracking refers to blockchain applications addressing ethical sourcing challenges for 3tg minerals (tin, tantalum, tungsten, gold) used in electronics, ensuring minerals don't finance armed conflict or human rights abuses in drc and adjoining regions. over 6,000 companies spend £500 million annually on conflict mineral due diligence under dodd-frank section 1502 and eu conflict minerals regulation, with blockchain implementations by circulor (volvo, vw, tesla), rcs global better sourcing (apple, samsung), and everledger demonstrating 40-60% reductions in due diligence costs through automated verification, immutable custody chains, and cryptographic material fingerprinting that enable 5-15% premium pricing for verified responsible sourcing whilst dramatically reducing human rights abuses.

- Industry adoption of blockchain for conflict mineral tracking has matured, with implementations demonstrating significant cost reductions and improved traceability.
  - Leading platforms include Circulor, RCS Global Better Sourcing, Everledger, and Minespider, which integrate blockchain with IoT sensors and cryptographic material fingerprinting.
  - These solutions enable automated verification, immutable custody chains, and digital product passports, facilitating 40-60% reductions in due diligence costs and enabling premium pricing (5-15%) for responsibly sourced minerals.
- UK companies and consortia are increasingly involved in blockchain-enabled ethical sourcing initiatives.
  - The Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI), with active participation from UK-based firms, supports traceability and standards compliance.
- North England is emerging as a hub for supply chain innovation, with cities like Manchester and Leeds fostering blockchain and IoT research relevant to mineral provenance.
- Technical capabilities include:
  - End-to-end traceability from mine to consumer.
  - Integration of blockchain with IoT for real-time tracking (the so-called ‘Blockchain of Things’).
  - Scalability and confidentiality features, such as those offered by Hyperledger Fabric.
- Limitations remain around data input reliability, interoperability between platforms, and inclusion of artisanal and small-scale mining operations.
- Regulatory frameworks continue to evolve, with the EU Conflict Minerals Regulation setting stringent due diligence requirements and encouraging technological solutions for compliance.

## UK Context

- The UK plays a significant role in advancing conflict mineral traceability through regulatory alignment and technological innovation.
  - UK-based companies contribute to blockchain platform development and participate in global initiatives such as the Responsible Minerals Initiative.
- North England cities, including Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield, host innovation hubs and research centres specialising in blockchain, IoT, and supply chain transparency.
  - These centres collaborate with industry and academia to pilot traceability solutions tailored to complex supply chains.
- Regional case studies demonstrate successful integration of blockchain with existing due diligence processes, enhancing transparency and reducing compliance costs for UK manufacturers and importers.

## Future Directions

- Emerging trends include:
  - Greater integration of blockchain with IoT and AI to enable predictive analytics and real-time risk assessment.
  - Expansion of traceability solutions to cover broader mineral categories and complex multi-tier supply chains.
  - Increased focus on social impact metrics alongside provenance data.
- Anticipated challenges:
  - Ensuring data accuracy and preventing “garbage in, garbage out” scenarios.
  - Balancing transparency with confidentiality and commercial sensitivity.
  - Scaling solutions to include artisanal and small-scale mining without imposing undue burdens.
- Research priorities:
  - Developing standardised protocols for blockchain interoperability.
  - Enhancing cryptographic methods for mineral fingerprinting.
  - Evaluating socio-economic outcomes of blockchain-enabled traceability on mining communities.
