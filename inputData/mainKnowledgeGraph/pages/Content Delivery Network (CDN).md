## Academic Context

- Brief contextual overview
	- A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a distributed system of servers and data centres that caches and delivers web content to users from geographically optimised locations, reducing latency and improving performance
	- The concept emerged in the late 1990s to address the growing demand for faster, more reliable content delivery as the internet became a critical medium for commerce, communication, and entertainment
	- CDNs are now a foundational layer in the internet ecosystem, supporting everything from static web assets to dynamic applications and real-time streaming

- Key developments and current state
	- Modern CDNs have evolved beyond simple caching to include advanced security features, load balancing, analytics, and integration with cloud platforms
	- The rise of mobile internet, high-definition streaming, and global e-commerce has driven widespread adoption and innovation in CDN technologies
	- CDNs are now integral to the digital experience, with over 90% of consumer internet traffic flowing through them

- Academic foundations
	- The theoretical underpinnings of CDNs draw from distributed systems, computer networking, and information theory
	- Research in this area continues to explore new architectures, optimisation techniques, and security protocols

## Current Landscape (2025)

- Industry adoption and implementations
	- CDNs are widely used by media companies, e-commerce vendors, and technology platforms to deliver content efficiently and securely
	- Major CDN providers include Akamai Technologies, Cloudflare, Amazon CloudFront, Fastly, and Google Cloud CDN
	- In the UK, CDNs are essential for supporting the digital infrastructure of businesses, public services, and educational institutions

- Notable organisations and platforms
	- Akamai Technologies: Global leader in CDN services, with a significant presence in the UK
	- Cloudflare: Known for its robust security features and global network, including data centres in Manchester and London
	- Amazon CloudFront: Part of AWS, widely used by UK businesses for content delivery and cloud computing
	- Fastly: Specialises in real-time content delivery and is popular among tech startups and media companies

- UK and North England examples where relevant
	- Manchester: Home to several data centres and tech hubs, including the Manchester Science Park, which hosts a variety of CDN-related services
	- Leeds: A growing tech cluster with companies leveraging CDNs for e-commerce and digital media
	- Newcastle: Known for its innovation in digital health and smart city initiatives, often using CDNs to support real-time data delivery
	- Sheffield: Home to the Advanced Manufacturing Park, which benefits from high-speed internet and CDN services for research and development

- Technical capabilities and limitations
	- CDNs excel at reducing latency, improving website performance, and enhancing user experience by serving content from locations closer to end users
	- They can also help protect against DDoS attacks and other malicious activities through advanced security features
	- However, CDNs do not host content and cannot replace the need for proper web hosting
	- Caching strategies must be carefully managed to ensure content freshness and avoid serving outdated information

- Standards and frameworks
	- Industry standards for CDNs include HTTP/2, HTTP/3, and various security protocols such as TLS/SSL
	- Frameworks for CDN management and optimisation are continually evolving, with a focus on automation, scalability, and security
