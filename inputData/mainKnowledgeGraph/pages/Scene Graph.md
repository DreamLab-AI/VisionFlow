## Academic Context

- Brief contextual overview
	- Scene graphs are a foundational data structure in computer graphics, widely used to organise and manage the spatial, logical, and rendering relationships among objects in a scene
	- The concept originated in the 1980s and has since become a standard approach in both academic and industrial graphics systems
	- Key developments and current state
		- Scene graphs have evolved from simple hierarchical trees to more complex, modular representations, supporting advanced features such as animation, culling, and real-time rendering
		- Modern scene graphs are integral to a wide range of applications, including video games, virtual reality, and scientific visualisation
	- Academic foundations
		- The theoretical underpinnings of scene graphs are rooted in graph theory and computer graphics, with significant contributions from researchers in the fields of computer science and engineering

## Current Landscape (2025)

- Industry adoption and implementations
	- Notable organisations and platforms
		- Scene graphs are used by major game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine, as well as by graphics libraries like OpenGL and DirectX
		- In the UK, companies such as Rockstar North (Edinburgh) and Frontier Developments (Cambridge) have adopted scene graph technologies in their game development pipelines
		- UK and North England examples where relevant
			- The University of Manchester has a strong research group in computer graphics, with ongoing projects that utilise scene graphs for scientific visualisation and virtual reality applications
			- Leeds Beckett University has a digital media research centre that explores the use of scene graphs in interactive media and educational software
			- Newcastle University's School of Computing Science has a focus on real-time graphics and has developed custom scene graph solutions for augmented reality and robotics
			- Sheffield Hallam University's Centre for Virtual Environments and Visualisation has applied scene graphs in the context of urban planning and architectural visualisation
	- Technical capabilities and limitations
		- Scene graphs enable efficient traversal, culling, and rendering operations, making them well-suited for complex scenes with many objects
		- They support hierarchical transformations, allowing for easy manipulation of groups of objects
		- Limitations include the potential for performance bottlenecks in very large or deeply nested graphs, and the need for careful management of memory and resources
	- Standards and frameworks
		- Common standards include the OpenSceneGraph (OSG) and the Scene Graph API in Unity
		- Frameworks such as CUGL (Cornell University Graphics Library) and the Scene Graph XML format used by Roku provide additional tools and specifications for creating and managing scene graphs
