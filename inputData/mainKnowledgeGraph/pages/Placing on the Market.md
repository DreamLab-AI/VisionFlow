## Placing on the Market

Placing on the Market refers to the first making available of an ai system on the union market.

- Industry adoption of AI systems compliant with the AI Act is accelerating, with providers increasingly aware of their responsibilities at the point of placing AI systems on the market.
  - Notable organisations include major European AI developers and integrators, alongside global providers adapting to EU rules.
  - In the UK, firms in Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield are actively engaging with AI compliance frameworks, particularly in sectors like finance, healthcare, and manufacturing.
- Technical capabilities now allow for detailed tracking of AI model training compute, aiding compliance assessments regarding significant modifications.
- Standards and frameworks are maturing, with the EU AI Act’s definitions guiding market surveillance and enforcement, while UK regulators align post-Brexit with similar principles to maintain market access and innovation.

- Ongoing research focuses on:
  - The impact of "placing on the market" on AI lifecycle governance.
  - Legal interpretations of provider responsibility for downstream AI model modifications.
  - The balance between innovation incentives and regulatory safeguards.

## UK Context

- Post-Brexit, the UK has adopted a regulatory approach broadly aligned with the EU AI Act, ensuring that AI systems placed on the UK market meet similar safety and transparency standards.
  - British contributions include research from the Alan Turing Institute and AI ethics initiatives in Northern England.
  - Innovation hubs in Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield are fostering AI development with regulatory compliance embedded from the outset.
- Regional case studies highlight collaborations between universities and industry to develop AI systems compliant with both UK and EU market requirements, reflecting the pragmatic need to navigate dual regulatory landscapes.

## Future Directions

- Emerging trends include:
  - Enhanced traceability of AI system provenance and training data to support compliance at the point of placing on the market.
  - Greater scrutiny of general-purpose AI models, especially regarding modifications that significantly alter capabilities or risks.
- Anticipated challenges:
  - Harmonising regulatory approaches between the UK and EU to avoid market fragmentation.
  - Addressing the complexities of AI systems that evolve post-market placement without breaching compliance.
- Research priorities:
  - Developing robust metrics for assessing "significant change" in AI models.
  - Exploring the interplay between provider obligations and deployer responsibilities throughout the AI system lifecycle.
