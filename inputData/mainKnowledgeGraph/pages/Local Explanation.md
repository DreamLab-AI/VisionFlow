## Local Explanation

Local Explanation refers to interpretability techniques that explain individual model predictions for specific instances, providing insight into why a particular input produced a given output without necessarily characterising the model's global behaviour.

- Industry adoption and implementations
  - Local explanation techniques are widely adopted across sectors, including finance, healthcare, and public services
  - Major platforms such as H2O.ai, DataRobot, and IBM Watson offer built-in local explanation tools
  - In the UK, organisations like NHS Digital and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) increasingly require local explanations for model transparency and accountability
- Notable organisations and platforms
  - NHS Digital uses local explanation to support clinical decision-making, ensuring clinicians understand why a model flagged a particular patient for intervention
  - The FCA mandates local explanations for credit scoring models to ensure fairness and transparency
  - In North England, Manchester-based AI startup Faculty has integrated local explanation into its public sector analytics platforms
- UK and North England examples where relevant
  - Leeds City Council uses local explanation to interpret predictive models for social services, helping caseworkers understand why certain families are flagged for support
  - Newcastle University’s Institute for Data Science applies local explanation in environmental monitoring, clarifying why specific sensor readings trigger alerts
  - Sheffield’s Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC) employs local explanation to diagnose faults in industrial processes, providing engineers with actionable insights
- Technical capabilities and limitations
  - Local explanation methods such as LIME, SHAP, and Anchors are robust for many use cases but can struggle with highly complex or non-linear models
  - Challenges include ensuring explanations are both accurate and interpretable, especially for non-technical stakeholders
  - There is ongoing debate about the trade-offs between explanation fidelity and computational efficiency
- Standards and frameworks
  - The UK’s Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation (CDEI) has published guidelines for local explanation in public sector AI
  - The European Union’s AI Act includes provisions for local explanation in high-risk applications
  - Industry standards such as the Open Explainable AI (OxAI) framework promote best practices for local explanation
