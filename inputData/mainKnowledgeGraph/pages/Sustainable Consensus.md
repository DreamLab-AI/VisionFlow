## Sustainable Consensus

Sustainable Consensus refers to a component of the blockchain ecosystem.

- Industry adoption increasingly favours consensus mechanisms that reduce energy consumption without compromising security.
  - Notable platforms include Ethereum (transitioned to PoS in 2022), Solana (using Proof of History combined with BFT), and emerging hybrid consensus models.
  - Innovations extend beyond PoW and PoS to include Proof of Identity (PoI) and other niche variants rewarding network participation over raw computational power.
- UK and North England examples:
  - Manchester and Leeds have burgeoning blockchain hubs focusing on sustainable fintech solutions.
  - Newcastle and Sheffield are home to academic research groups exploring green blockchain protocols and their applications in supply chain transparency.
- Technical capabilities:
  - Modern consensus algorithms achieve higher scalability and lower latency while significantly reducing energy use compared to PoW.
  - Limitations include potential centralisation risks in PoS and complexity in hybrid models.
- Standards and frameworks:
  - IEEE 3220.01-2025 provides a consensus framework standardising blockchain state consistency in distributed networks.
  - Regulatory frameworks, such as the EU MiCA regulation, increasingly mandate sustainability reporting for blockchain service providers.
