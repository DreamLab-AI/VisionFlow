2. **Affected persons**: Individuals and groups whose rights at stake
3. **Nature of impact**: Positive, negative, direct, indirect effects
4. **Severity**: Magnitude and reversibility of rights impacts
5. **Mitigation**: Measures to prevent or minimise rights infringements
6. **Safeguards**: Procedural protections ensuring rights respect

## Contemporary Human Rights Challenges in AI [Updated 2025]

### Privacy Violations and Surveillance Systems

- **AI-powered surveillance** identified as top human rights threat in 2024-2025
- **EU AI Act bans** (effective August 2024):
	- Untargeted scraping of internet or CCTV for [[facial recognition]] databases
	- Real-time remote [[biometric identification]] in public spaces by law enforcement (narrow exceptions permitted)
- **UK developments**: Information Commissioner's Office consulting on [[data protection]] compliance in AI supply chain
- **Emerging concerns**:
	- Pervasive monitoring chilling free expression and political participation
	- [[Facial recognition]] accuracy disparities disproportionately harming racial minorities
	- Emotional recognition technologies invading psychological privacy
- **Related**: [[Surveillance Technology]], [[Biometric Data]], [[Privacy by Design]]

### Employment Discrimination [Updated 2025]

- **UK Government Report** (2023): Between **10-30% of UK jobs considered automatable** due to AI advances
	- Base case: **7% of jobs** face high (>70%) probability of automation within 5 years
	- Projections: **18% within 10 years**, **30% within 20 years**
	- Most affected sectors: Wholesale/retail, finance, public administration
- **Entry-level and part-time jobs** particularly vulnerable
	- Women and younger workers disproportionately affected
- **AI-related employment growth**: 64,500 FTE in AI sector (2023), up 29% from 2022
- **Scenarios**:
	- Worst case: Up to **7.9 million UK jobs** at risk
	- Central scenario: **4.4 million jobs** disappear, **£144bn GDP gain**
	- Best case: All jobs augmented, **£306bn GDP gain**, no job losses

### The Art of the Desirable vs. Technological Determinism [Updated 2025]

Technology futurist [[Tom Cheesewright]] distinguishes between:
- **The art of the possible**: What can be achieved within technological boundaries
- **The art of the desirable**: What we *should* pursue based on human values
- **The art of the probable**: What is most likely to happen, driven by economic factors
**Key insight**: Technology has no intrinsic agency—humans make choices within technological possibilities. The future of work must prioritize:
- **Protecting choice**: Individuals should pursue roles matching their preferences
- **Investing in human-centred training**: Cultivating communication, empathy, critical thinking
- **Fostering social dialogue**: Democratic approach to work's future, not top-down Silicon Valley dictates
**Citation**: Cheesewright, T., "The art of the probable, the possible, and the desirable" (2015)
- **Related**: [[Human Agency]], [[Future of Work]], [[Social Contract]]

### Digital Rights and Bot Proliferation [Updated 2025]

The **"dead internet theory"** (originally conspiracy theory) describes how bots and AI increasingly dominate online activity:
**Statistics (2024-2025)**:
- **51% of global internet traffic** is bots (up from 47.4% in 2022)
- **X (Twitter)**: 64% of accounts may be bots; 76% of traffic at peak times is automation
- **Instagram**: 95 million fake accounts (9.5%); 14.1% of followers are bots/inactive
- **Meta**: 430 million inauthentic/duplicate accounts (14% of monthly active users)
- **Prediction**: Up to **99% of internet content** could be AI-generated by 2025-2026
**Human Rights Implications**:
- **Manipulation of public discourse**: Coordinated bot campaigns spread [[disinformation]]
- **Erosion of authentic human connection**: AI-generated content displacing genuine interaction
- **Suppression of dissent**: Automated systems amplify propaganda, drown out activists
- **Loss of digital autonomy**: Algorithmic curation controls what information users access
**Platform Responses**:
- Identity verification requirements (email, SMS, government ID)
- AI tools increasingly bypass verification systems
- Some platforms implementing paid memberships to deter bot farms
**Citations**:

### Legal Access and AI in Justice Systems [Updated 2025]

US Chief Justice John Roberts' 2023 Year-End Report highlighted AI's potential and risks:
**Opportunities**:
- **Increased access to justice** for litigants with limited resources
- AI-driven tools provide templates, court forms, guidance without leaving home
- Legal research enhanced by AI capabilities
**Concerns**:
- **AI "hallucination"**: Lawyers submitted briefs citing non-existent cases
- **Confidentiality risks**: Entering information into AI may compromise [[legal privilege]]
- **Algorithmic bias** in flight risk, recidivism, and discretionary decisions
- **"Human-AI fairness gap"**: Public perception that human adjudication fairer than algorithmic
**Key Principle**: "Machines cannot fully replace key actors in court"
- Judges assess sincerity through human cues: shaking hands, voice inflection, eye contact
- Appellate decisions involve fact-specific grey areas requiring human judgment
- AI based on existing information cannot make novel legal determinations
**Citation**: Roberts, J., *2023 Year-End Report on the Federal Judiciary*, US Supreme Court (2023)

## A New Social Contract for AI [Updated 2025]

Navigating the intersection of AI and global politics necessitates establishing a **new social contract for AI**—one that:
- **Respects human rights** as foundational, not optional
- **Promotes equitable economic growth** and addresses automation's distributional impacts
- **Protects national security** while preserving civil liberties
- **Ensures democratic participation** in AI governance decisions
- **Prioritizes human agency** over technological determinism
- **Addresses power asymmetries** between technology companies and individuals
**Key Elements**:
- Binding international frameworks ([[Council of Europe AI Treaty]], [[EU AI Act]])
- Multi-stakeholder governance involving civil society, workers, policymakers
- Robust enforcement mechanisms and accountability for violations
- Investment in human-centred training and reskilling
- Protection of choice and individual autonomy in work and digital life
- **Related**: [[AI Governance]], [[Social Contract]], [[Democratic AI]], [[Stakeholder Capitalism]]

## Challenges

- **Balancing**: Managing tensions between competing rights (privacy vs security)
- **Context sensitivity**: Rights frameworks varying across jurisdictions
- **Technical translation**: Implementing abstract rights in technical systems
- **Enforcement**: Ensuring practical redress for rights violations
- **Emerging issues**: Addressing AI-specific rights challenges not contemplated by historical frameworks
