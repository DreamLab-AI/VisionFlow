## Academic Context

- Brief contextual overview
  - The 3D Scene Exchange Protocol (SXP) is an open standard designed to enable the interoperable transfer of 3D scene graphs, materials, and animations between diverse software platforms and rendering engines.
  - It emerged to address the growing need for seamless asset exchange in digital content creation, particularly in visual effects, gaming, and architectural visualisation.
  - Key developments include the formalisation of schema definitions and the integration of SXP into major 3D authoring tools and pipelines, fostering collaborative workflows across studios and disciplines.

- Academic foundations
  - The protocol draws on principles from computer graphics, scene graph theory, and data interoperability research.
  - Early work was influenced by standards such as glTF and USD, but SXP distinguishes itself with a focus on extensibility and real-time collaboration.
  - Research in distributed rendering and collaborative editing has further shaped SXP’s design, making it suitable for cloud-based and multi-user environments.

## Current Landscape (2025)

- Industry adoption and implementations
  - SXP is widely adopted in the visual effects and gaming industries, with support in major 3D software such as Blender, Maya, and Unreal Engine.
  - Notable organisations using SXP include Framestore, MPC, and DNEG, all of which have studios in the UK.
  - In North England, companies like Atomhawk (Newcastle) and The Mill (Manchester) have integrated SXP into their workflows for collaborative 3D asset management.

- Technical capabilities and limitations
  - SXP supports the transfer of complex 3D scene graphs, materials, and animations, including support for real-time updates and collaborative editing.
  - Limitations include challenges with handling extremely large datasets and ensuring consistent performance across different rendering engines.
  - The protocol is continually evolving to address these limitations and improve interoperability.

- Standards and frameworks
  - SXP is aligned with industry standards such as glTF and USD, ensuring compatibility with existing workflows.
  - The protocol is maintained by the MSF Interchange Working Group, which oversees its development and adoption.
