## ESG Reporting

ESG Reporting refers to a component of the blockchain ecosystem.

- Industry adoption and implementations
  - ESG reporting is now a standard practice across major industries, with increasing reliance on digital platforms for data collection, validation, and disclosure
  - Leading ESG reporting platforms include Solvexia, Coolset, and Kaleido, which offer integrated solutions for automation, analytics, and blockchain-based assurance
  - UK-based organisations such as the Centre for Sustainability & Excellence (CSE) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) have developed training programmes and guidance for ESG reporting, reflecting the growing importance of sustainability in financial regulation
- Notable organisations and platforms
  - Solvexia: Provides ESG data management tools with blockchain integration for assurance
  - Coolset: Offers ESG reporting software aligned with GRI, SASB, TCFD, and ISSB frameworks
  - Kaleido: Specialises in blockchain solutions for ESG management, with use cases in supply chain traceability and emissions reporting
- UK and North England examples where relevant
  - Manchester-based firms have adopted blockchain for ESG reporting in the energy and manufacturing sectors, leveraging local innovation hubs for pilot projects
  - Leeds and Newcastle have seen increased collaboration between universities and industry on ESG data management, with Sheffield hosting regional workshops on sustainable finance
- Technical capabilities and limitations
  - Blockchain enables real-time, tamper-proof recording of ESG data, improving transparency and auditability
  - Limitations include scalability challenges, energy consumption concerns (particularly for proof-of-work blockchains), and the need for interoperability with existing reporting systems
- Standards and frameworks
  - ESG reporting is guided by international standards such as GRI, SASB, TCFD, and the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB)
  - The UK’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Climate Disclosure Rule have raised the bar for data quality and transparency

  - Leeds: A manufacturing firm adopted blockchain for supply chain traceability, enhancing its ESG credentials and stakeholder trust

## Future Directions

- Emerging trends and developments
  - Expect increased adoption of AI-driven analytics and tokenised sustainability incentives in ESG reporting
  - Blockchain is likely to enable continuous, real-time ESG reporting, moving beyond periodic disclosures
- Anticipated challenges
  - Scalability and energy consumption remain key challenges for blockchain in ESG reporting
  - Interoperability with existing reporting systems and regulatory frameworks will require ongoing attention
- Research priorities
  - Research should focus on improving the scalability and energy efficiency of blockchain for ESG reporting
  - Studies should explore the integration of AI-driven analytics with blockchain to enhance predictive capabilities and anomaly detection in ESG data
