- ### Multi-Modal Large Language Models (LLMs)
	- **Introduction:**
		- [[Large language models]] are adept at generating coherent text sequences, predicting word probabilities and co-occurrences.
		- Multimodal models extend LLMs capabilities to not just output text, but images and understand multimodal inputs.
	- **Core Concepts:**
		- **LLMs for Text:**
			- LLMs process prompts and generate replies one token at a time, acting as a multiclass classifier.
		- **Image Generation:**
			- Traditional pixel-by-pixel image generation is intractable; hence, a different approach is needed.
			- The solution is treating image generation as a language generation problem, akin to ancient hieroglyphics.
	- **Techniques in Multi-Modal LLMs:**
		- **Autoencoders:**
			- Compress images into a lower-dimensional latent space and then regenerate them, learning crucial properties.
		- **[[Variational Autoencoders]] (VAE) & VQ-VAE:**
			- VAEs add a generative aspect by allowing for new image generation from random latent embeddings.
			- VQ-VAE further discretizes this process, creating a vocabulary of image "words" or tokens.
	- **Implementation:**
		- **Vector Quantization:**
			- Creates a discrete set of embedding vectors forming the vocabulary for our image-based language.
		- **Encoding and Decoding:**
			- Images are encoded to these discrete codes and decoded back to form new or reconstructed images.
	- **Training and Inference:**
		- A mixed sequence of embeddings (words and image tokens) is created for training.
		- The model learns to generate image tokens, forming a coherent sequence with the text, allowing for the generation of images corresponding to text descriptions.
	- **Challenges and Developments:**
		- The importance of quality data over quantity, especially for large, complex models.
		- Ongoing efforts focus on refining data quality, applying safety measures, and improving model transparency.

- # Distilling Social Complexity: A Knowledge Graph and Ontology Approach for Immersive Environments
- ## Introduction
	- Capturing complex social dynamics in real-time immersive environments is a novel research area
	- Combines knowledge graphs, ontologies, and multi-modal Large Language Models (LLMs)
	- Aims to distil and bound complexity to constrain errors in deep search by naive multi-modal models
- ## Defining the Scope and Ontology
	- Identify the specific type of social interactions being modelled (e.g., professional events, casual gatherings, online communities)
	- Develop a formal ontology capturing core concepts:
		- Actors: Individuals, groups, organizations
		- Relationships: Friend, colleague, family, competitor, influencer
		- Interactions: Conversation, gesture, post, like, share
		- Context: Location, time, event, shared activities
		- Social Signals: Proximity, eye contact, tone of voice, facial expressions
	- Define properties and attributes to describe these concepts in detail
