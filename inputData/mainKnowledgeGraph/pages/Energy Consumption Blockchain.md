## Energy Consumption Blockchain

Energy Consumption Blockchain refers to a component of the blockchain ecosystem.

- Industry adoption of blockchain for energy consumption management is growing, with platforms enabling peer-to-peer energy trading and decentralised grid management.
  - Notable platforms focus on scalability, security, privacy, and regulatory compliance to support sustainable energy markets[4].
  - Technical limitations include energy consumption of blockchain networks themselves, especially proof-of-work consensus mechanisms, which have prompted shifts towards more energy-efficient protocols like proof-of-stake.
- In the UK, blockchain applications in energy are emerging within smart grid projects and renewable energy certificates trading.
  - North England cities such as Manchester and Leeds host innovation hubs exploring blockchain for local energy markets and sustainability initiatives.
- Standards and frameworks are evolving to address interoperability, data privacy, and environmental impact, with increasing regulatory attention on the carbon footprint of blockchain operations[3].
