## Explainable AI

Explainable AI refers to ai systems designed to provide clear, understandable explanations of their decision-making processes, enabling stakeholders to comprehend how and why specific outputs are generated.

- Industry adoption of XAI has expanded significantly, driven by regulatory demands (e.g., GDPR), ethical AI initiatives, and the need for trust in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems.
  - Leading organisations like Google, IBM, and DARPA continue to invest heavily in XAI research and development.
  - Technical capabilities now include model-agnostic explanation methods, interpretable surrogate models, and inherently transparent algorithms, though challenges remain in balancing interpretability with model performance.
  - Standards and frameworks, such as those proposed by NIST, emphasise explanation, meaningfulness, accuracy, and operational boundaries.
- In the UK, and particularly in North England, AI innovation hubs in Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield are integrating XAI into healthcare diagnostics, smart city projects, and financial services.
  - For example, Manchester’s AI research centres collaborate with local NHS trusts to develop explainable diagnostic tools, enhancing clinician and patient trust.
  - Leeds and Sheffield are advancing explainability in urban planning AI systems, ensuring transparency in automated decision-making affecting public services.
