# Metaverse Ontology Schema
		
		  ## Purpose
		  This page defines the property schema used across the metaverse glossary to enable consistent ontology representation.
		
		  ## Core Relationship Properties
		
		  ### Taxonomic Relationships
		  - `is-a::` - Direct parent class (e.g., Avatar is-a Digital Representation)
		  - `subclass-of::` - Broader classification
		  - `instance-of::` - Specific instantiation
		
		  ### Compositional Relationships
		  - `has-part::` - Component relationships (e.g., Virtual World has-part Avatar)
		  - `consists-of::` - Aggregation of elements
		  - `contains::` - Containment relationships
		
		  ### Dependency Relationships
		  - `requires::` - Prerequisites (e.g., VR Experience requires VR Headset)
		  - `depends-on::` - Dependencies
		  - `uses::` - Utilization relationships
		
		  ### Capability Relationships
		  - `enables::` - Capabilities provided (e.g., Blockchain enables Decentralization)
		  - `supports::` - Support relationships
		  - `provides::` - Provisions
		
		  ### Association Relationships
		  - `related-to::` - General semantic association
		  - `used-in::` - Application contexts
		  - `implements::` - Realization of specifications
		
		  ## Metadata Properties
		
		  ### Identification
		  - `term-id::` - Unique numeric identifier from source glossary
		  - `preferred-term::` - Canonical term name
		  - `abbreviation::` - Standard abbreviation if applicable
		
		  ### Documentation
		  - `definition::` - Formal standards-style definition
		  - `notes::` - Explanatory context and usage notes
		  - `example::` - Usage examples
		
		  ### Classification
		  - `domain::` - ETSI functional domain classification
		  - `layer::` - EWG architectural layer
		  - `aspect::` - MSF aspect or vertical
		
		  ### Provenance
		  - `source::` - Primary authoritative source
		  - `primary-source::` - Main reference document
		  - `additional-sources::` - Other defining sources
		  - `also-defined-in::` - Cross-references to other standards
		
		  ### Status & Maturity
		  - `maturity::` - Term maturity level (draught / mature / deprecated)
		  - `version::` - Specification version
		  - `status::` - Standardization status
    - public-access:: true
		  - `ontology-status::` - Internal tracking (needs-relationships / complete)
    - public-access:: true
		
		  ### Terminology
		  - `synonyms::` - Equivalent alternative terms
		  - `variant-terms::` - Related term variants
		  - `see-also::` - Recommended cross-references
		
		  ## Usage Guidelines
		
		  ### Creating New Term Pages
		  1. Use the template structure
		  2. Fill in all applicable core properties
		  3. Add at least one ontological relationship
		  4. Classify by domain and layer
		  5. Update ontology-status to 'complete' when relationships are defined
		
		  ### Relationship Cardinality
		  - Single value: `property:: [[Value]]`
		  - Multiple values: `property:: [[Value1]], [[Value2]], [[Value3]]`
		  - List format:
		  ```
		  property::
		    - [[Value1]]
		    - [[Value2]]
		    - [[Value3]]
		  ```
		
		  ### Naming Conventions
		  - Use singular forms for concepts: [[Avatar]] not [[Avatars]]
		  - Title case for proper concepts
		  - Lowercase for general attributes
		  - Create alias pages for common variants
		
		  ## Validation Queries
		
		  ### Find Incomplete Terms
		  ```clojure
		  {{query (property ontology-status needs-relationships)}}
		  ```
		
		  ### Find Terms Without Domain
		  ```clojure
		  #+BEGIN_QUERY
		  {:query [:find ?term
		           :where
		           [?p :block/name ?term]
		           [?p :block/properties ?props]
		           [(missing? $ ?p :block/properties :domain)]]
		  }
		  #+END_QUERY
		  ```
		
		  ### Find Orphaned Terms (No Relationships)
		  ```clojure
		  #+BEGIN_QUERY
		  {:query [:find ?term
		           :where
		           [?p :block/name ?term]
		           [?p :block/properties ?props]
		           [(missing? $ ?p :block/properties :is-a)]
		           [(missing? $ ?p :block/properties :has-part)]
		           [(missing? $ ?p :block/properties :related-to)]]
		  }
		  #+END_QUERY
		  ```
		
		  ## Maintenance
		
		  This schema should be reviewed and updated as:
		  - New relationship types are identified
		  - Domain classification evolves
		  - Standards references are updated
		  - Community feedback is incorporated
		
		  schema-version:: 1.0
		  last-updated:: [[2025-01-15]]
		  maintained-by:: Ontology Working Group
		
		  ```

# Metaverse Ontology Schema — Updated Content

## Academic Context

- Ontology in artificial intelligence represents a formal specification of knowledge as structured concepts and their interrelationships[3]
  - Defines "what exists" within a domain and establishes the semantic backbone for intelligent systems
  - Functions as a knowledge graph's grammar, enabling machines to reason about complex domains
  - Particularly crucial as AI systems grow more context-aware and require structured knowledge representation
- Domain ontologies for emerging technologies follow established methodological frameworks
  - METHONTOLOGY and Cyc 101 represent the predominant combined approach for contemporary ontology development[1][2]
  - Four-stage construction process: domain scope determination, ontology reuse, conceptual model development, and rigorous evaluation
  - Quality assessment employs multiple evaluation metrics to verify limitations and criteria satisfaction[1]

## Current Landscape (2025)

- Metaverse ontology development has matured from theoretical concept to practical implementation
  - MetaOntology framework provides explicit specification of state-of-the-art technologies relevant to metaverse environments[1][2]
  - Protégé software facilitates implementation with support for RDF and OWL 2 Web Ontology Language specifications from the W3C Consortium[1][2]
  - Technology tree approaches now complement traditional ontological models, automatically generating ontologies from large datasets[5]
- Industrial and commercial applications demonstrate tangible adoption
  - Digital twin data combined with extended reality (XR and VR) representations define key metaverse components[4]
  - Standardisation efforts through the Metaverse Standards Forum establish relationships between metaverse components[4]
  - Distinction between industrial metaverse (requiring gas analysers rather than magic swords, one notes) and retail/entertainment metaverse applications[4]
- Technical capabilities encompass multi-engine architecture
  - Blockchain-based implementations now support multiple virtual machines (NeoVM, Wasm, EVM) within unified chains[6]
  - Cross-chain token compatibility enables seamless asset migration between ontological systems[6]
- UK and North England context
  - Manchester and Leeds emerging as digital innovation hubs with growing metaverse research initiatives
  - Sheffield's advanced manufacturing sector exploring industrial metaverse applications for digital twin integration
  - Newcastle's digital economy initiatives incorporating ontological frameworks for smart city development
