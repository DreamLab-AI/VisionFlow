- ## About Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
  [[Decentralized Finance]] (DeFi) represents a revolutionary transformation of traditional financial services through [[blockchain]] technology, enabling permissionless, transparent, and programmable financial applications without intermediary control. As of 2025, the DeFi ecosystem manages over $100 billion in [[Total Value Locked]] (TVL) across hundreds of protocols, fundamentally challenging centralised finance paradigms.

- ## Core Principles and Architecture

- ### Foundational Concepts
  - **Permissionless Access**: Anyone with an [[internet]] connection and [[cryptocurrency]] wallet can access DeFi services without [[Know Your Customer]] (KYC) requirements or geographic restrictions
  - **Non-Custodial Control**: Users maintain full custody of assets through [[private keys]], eliminating counterparty risk from centralised intermediaries
  - **Transparency**: All transactions and [[smart contract]] code are publicly auditable on [[blockchain]] networks, enabling trustless verification
  - **Composability**: DeFi protocols function as "money legos," allowing developers to combine protocols into complex financial instruments
  - **Programmable Money**: [[Smart contracts]] automate financial agreements, eliminating manual intermediation and reducing operational costs
  - **24/7 Global Markets**: DeFi operates continuously without trading hours, settlement delays, or geographic boundaries
  - **Algorithmic Governance**: Many protocols use [[Decentralized Autonomous Organizations]] (DAOs) for community-driven governance
  - **Censorship Resistance**: Transactions cannot be blocked or reversed by centralised authorities

- ## DeFi Primitives and Core Mechanisms

- ### Automated Market Makers (AMMs)
  - **Constant Product Formula**: [[Uniswap]] pioneered the x*y=k model enabling permissionless [[liquidity pools]]
  - **Liquidity Provision**: Users deposit token pairs to earn trading fees, typically 0.3% per swap
  - **Impermanent Loss**: Liquidity providers face potential losses when token prices diverge from deposit ratios
  - **Concentrated Liquidity**: [[Uniswap v4]] (2025) allows LPs to provide liquidity within custom price ranges, increasing capital efficiency by 4000x
  - **Hook Architecture**: Uniswap v4's customizable hooks enable developers to add custom AMM logic for advanced strategies
  - **Multi-Pool Routing**: Advanced AMM aggregators split trades across multiple pools for optimal pricing
  - **Dynamic Fees**: Protocols adjust fees based on market volatility and pool utilization

- ### Lending and Borrowing Protocols
  - **Overcollateralized Lending**: [[Aave v3]], [[Compound]], and [[MakerDAO]] require collateral exceeding loan value (typically 150-200%)
  - **Interest Rate Models**: Algorithmic rates adjust based on supply/demand dynamics within each lending pool
  - **Liquidation Mechanisms**: Automated liquidations occur when collateral falls below minimum thresholds, protecting protocol solvency
  - **Flash Loans**: [[Aave]] pioneered uncollateralized loans requiring repayment within single transaction block
  - **Isolation Mode**: Aave v3 introduces asset isolation, limiting risk exposure from newly listed tokens
  - **E-Mode**: Efficiency mode enables higher leverage (up to 97% LTV) for correlated assets like stablecoins
  - **Cross-Chain Lending**: 2025 protocols enable lending across [[Ethereum]], [[Polygon]], [[Arbitrum]], and [[Optimism]]
  - **Variable vs Stable Rates**: Borrowers choose between variable rates (lower) and stable rates (predictable)

- ### Yield Farming and Liquidity Mining
  - **Incentivized Liquidity**: Protocols distribute governance tokens to liquidity providers to bootstrap adoption
  - **Yield Aggregators**: [[Yearn Finance]] and similar protocols automatically optimise yield strategies across multiple protocols
  - **Compounding Strategies**: Auto-compounding vaults reinvest rewards to maximise returns through compound interest
  - **Risk-Adjusted Returns**: Advanced strategies balance yield optimization with smart contract risk exposure
  - **Locked Staking**: [[Curve Finance]] offers boosted rewards for users locking [[CRV]] tokens up to 4 years
  - **Gauge Voting**: Token holders vote to direct liquidity mining rewards to preferred pools
  - **Bribe Markets**: Secondary markets enable protocols to incentivize voting for their liquidity pools

- ### Derivatives and Synthetic Assets
  - **Perpetual Futures**: [[dYdX]], [[GMX]], and [[Gains Network]] offer leveraged trading without expiration dates
  - **Options Protocols**: [[Lyra]], [[Dopex]], and [[Hegic]] enable decentralized options trading
  - **Synthetic Assets**: [[Synthetix]] creates synthetic exposure to commodities, forex, and equities on-chain
  - **Prediction Markets**: [[Polymarket]] and [[Augur]] enable betting on real-world events with cryptocurrency
  - **Interest Rate Swaps**: Protocols like [[Pendle]] enable trading of future yield
  - **Volatility Products**: Structured products capture volatility premiums through automated strategies
