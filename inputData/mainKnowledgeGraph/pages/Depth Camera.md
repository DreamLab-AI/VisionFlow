## Academic Context

- Brief contextual overview
  - Depth cameras are imaging devices capable of capturing the distance to objects in a scene, enabling three-dimensional (3D) spatial perception
  - Key developments and current state
    - Modern depth cameras utilise technologies such as structured light, time-of-flight (ToF), and stereo vision to generate depth maps
    - These systems are foundational in robotics, augmented reality, healthcare, and smart environments
  - Academic foundations
    - Theoretical underpinnings draw from computer vision, photogrammetry, and signal processing
    - Early research focused on stereo matching and disparity estimation; recent advances leverage machine learning for improved accuracy and robustness
