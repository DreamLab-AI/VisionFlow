## Academic Context

- Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs) are a foundational type of artificial neural network characterised by unidirectional data flow from input to output layers without cycles or feedback loops.
  - They consist of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer, with each neuron in a layer fully connected to neurons in the subsequent layer.
  - The network learns by adjusting connection weights through optimisation algorithms such as gradient descent, minimising a loss function that quantifies prediction errors.
  - Activation functions like ReLU, sigmoid, or tanh introduce non-linearity, enabling the modelling of complex patterns beyond linear relationships.
- Academically, FNNs underpin many developments in machine learning and deep learning, serving as the conceptual basis for more complex architectures like convolutional and recurrent neural networks.

## Current Landscape (2025)

- FNNs remain widely used for pattern recognition tasks including image and speech classification, credit scoring, and regression problems.
  - Their simplicity and interpretability make them a preferred choice for baseline models and educational purposes.
- Notable organisations employing FNNs include technology firms, financial institutions, and healthcare analytics companies.
  - In the UK, several AI research centres and companies in Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield integrate FNNs within broader AI solutions, particularly in sectors such as finance, healthcare, and manufacturing.
- Technical capabilities:
  - FNNs excel at modelling static data but are limited in handling sequential or temporal data due to their lack of feedback connections.
  - They are computationally less intensive than recurrent or convolutional networks but may require careful tuning to avoid overfitting or underfitting.
- Standards and frameworks supporting FNN development include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and ONNX, which facilitate model interoperability and deployment.
