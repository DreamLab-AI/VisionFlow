# Metaverse Architecture Stack – Updated Ontology Entry

## Academic Context

- The Metaverse Architecture Stack represents a foundational framework for enabling interoperability across distributed virtual environments and systems[1][4]
  - Emerged from recognition that early-stage metaverse development lacks mature, standardised architectural consensus between academia and industry[4]
  - Addresses complexity of integrating real and virtual elements through layered component organisation
  - Encompasses infrastructure, interactivity, and ecosystem dimensions to establish common ground for development[4]

- IEEE P2048 Standard for Metaverse: Terminology, Definitions, and Taxonomy provides the primary standardisation effort[1][2]
  - Approved by IEEE Standards Association Board on 10 November 2022[2][3]
  - Intended to define terminology, categories, and levels of metaverse systems whilst facilitating sustainable development[1]
  - Addresses early-stage confusion and lack of consensus that could mislead adopters and create unnecessary barriers[1]

## Current Landscape (2025)

- Infrastructure requirements and technical stack
  - Hardware components include high-performance servers (GPU), storage systems, and data centres capable of processing vast quantities of virtual environment data[4]
  - Software development tools, programming languages, and frameworks enable creation of immersive environments ranging from 2D applications to complex 3D simulations[4]
  - Networking technologies essential for real-time, low-latency connectivity include high-speed broadband, 5G/6G wireless networks, and edge computing solutions[4]
  - Blockchain, cloud-edge computing, storage systems, and interoperability protocols form critical infrastructure layers[4]

- Standards and frameworks currently active
  - IEEE 2888 standardises interfaces between physical and virtual worlds, defining data formats and APIs[1]
  - IEEE P7016 provides ethical assessment methodology and techno-social overview for metaverse system design and operation[1]
  - ISO/IEC 23005 offers guidelines for metaverse design, development, and deployment[1]
  - IEEE P3812.1 addresses identity framework requirements for metaverse systems (approved 3 December 2022)[2][3]
  - IEEE initiatives on persistent computing and decentralised metaverse architectures approved for development[2][3]

- Technical capabilities and current limitations
  - Real-time interactivity across multiple devices and platforms remains technically challenging at scale
  - Standardised data formats and APIs still under development, limiting cross-platform interoperability
  - Edge computing and 5G/6G deployment remains incomplete in many regions, constraining low-latency performance

## Research & Literature

- Key academic sources
  - Metaverse Survey & Tutorial: Exploring Key Requirements (arXiv 2405.04718v1) provides comprehensive overview of architectural frameworks and infrastructure requirements[4]
  - IEEE P2048 documentation establishes foundational terminology and taxonomy for sustainable metaverse development[1][2]
  - Metaverse: Requirements, Architecture, Standards, Status (arXiv 2302.01125) details standards landscape and key technological requirements[1]

- Ongoing research directions
  - Standardisation of interoperability protocols across heterogeneous platforms
  - Ethical assessment methodologies for metaverse system design (IEEE P7016.1 for extended reality and educational metadata)
  - Identity framework specifications and decentralised architecture models
  - Integration of persistent computing capabilities

## UK Context

- British involvement in standards development
  - IEEE Metaverse Standards Committee operates through international accredited processes with UK participation in working groups
  - UK academic institutions contributing to research on metaverse architecture and interoperability standards

- Regional considerations
  - 5G/6G infrastructure deployment across UK regions affects practical implementation of low-latency metaverse systems
  - North England technology hubs (Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle) increasingly engaged with immersive technology research, though specific metaverse architecture initiatives remain limited to broader XR development programmes

## Future Directions

- Emerging technical priorities
  - Completion and ratification of IEEE P2048 taxonomy and terminology standards to establish industry consensus
  - Development of mature interoperability protocols enabling seamless cross-platform user experiences
  - Advancement of edge computing and 6G networking to support real-time, low-latency interactions at scale

- Anticipated challenges
  - Reconciling divergent architectural approaches between major platform developers and academic standardisation bodies
  - Establishing ethical frameworks that balance innovation with user protection and data privacy
  - Achieving backwards compatibility whilst evolving standards for emerging technologies

- Research priorities
  - Formal specification of layered architecture models with explicit ordering constraints and cardinality requirements
  - Evaluation of decentralised versus centralised architectural approaches for different use cases
  - Integration of identity and authentication frameworks with privacy-preserving mechanisms
