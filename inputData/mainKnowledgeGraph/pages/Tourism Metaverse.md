## Academic Context

- Brief contextual overview
	- The Tourism Metaverse refers to the integration of immersive digital environments—primarily virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR)—into the tourism sector, enabling users to explore, preview, and experience destinations and cultural sites remotely.
	- Key developments and current state
		- The metaverse in tourism has evolved from simple virtual tours to interactive, multi-sensory experiences that blend digital and physical travel, supporting accessibility and sustainable tourism practices.
		- Academic foundations
			- Research in tourism and hospitality increasingly focuses on how immersive technologies reshape consumer behaviour, destination marketing, and service delivery.
			- Theoretical frameworks such as the Means-end Chain and soft laddering have been applied to understand the value hierarchies and psychological benefits of metaverse tourism experiences (Buhalis et al., 2025).

## Current Landscape (2025)

- Industry adoption and implementations
	- Notable organisations and platforms
		- Major travel brands and destination marketing organisations (DMOs) use metaverse platforms for virtual destination previews, interactive storytelling, and immersive marketing campaigns.
		- Examples include browser-based platforms like Decentraland and ZEPETO, which have been adopted by international tourism boards for virtual exhibitions and cultural showcases.
	- UK and North England examples where relevant
		- UK tourism boards have piloted virtual experiences for heritage sites, such as the Roman Baths in Bath and the Lake District, with some North England cities like Manchester and Leeds exploring AR-enhanced city tours.
		- The National Trust has experimented with VR experiences for remote access to historic properties, including properties in Northumberland and Yorkshire.
	- Technical capabilities and limitations
		- Capabilities
			- Hyper-realistic VR environments, interactive avatars, and real-time data integration allow for immersive previews and personalised tours.
			- AR integration enables overlaying digital information onto physical environments, enhancing on-site experiences.
		- Limitations
			- Sensory fidelity remains limited; experiences are primarily visual and auditory, with limited tactile or olfactory feedback.
			- Accessibility barriers persist for users without advanced hardware or reliable internet connectivity.
	- Standards and frameworks
		- Industry standards for interoperability and user experience are still evolving, with organisations like the Open Metaverse Alliance working to establish common protocols.
