## Academic Context

- Activation functions are mathematical functions applied to the output of individual neurons in artificial neural networks.
  - They introduce **non-linearity**, enabling networks to learn complex, non-linear relationships in data that linear models cannot capture.
  - This non-linearity is essential for tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and other sophisticated pattern recognition problems.
- The output of a neuron is computed as the activation function applied to the weighted sum of inputs plus a bias term.
  - Formally: Output = ActivationFunction(Σ(Weight × Input) + Bias).
- Activation functions are generally differentiable or piecewise differentiable, facilitating gradient-based optimisation methods like backpropagation.
- Early foundational work established the universal approximation theorem, showing that neural networks with suitable activation functions can approximate any continuous function.
  - Pinkus (1999) demonstrated that activation functions need not be bounded to satisfy universal approximation, paving the way for unbounded functions like ReLU.

## Current Landscape (2025)

- Activation functions remain a critical component in deep learning architectures, with several widely adopted types:
  - **Sigmoid**: Outputs between 0 and 1; historically popular but prone to vanishing gradients.
  - **Tanh**: Outputs between -1 and 1; zero-centred but still susceptible to gradient issues.
  - **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**: Outputs zero for negative inputs and identity for positive inputs; computationally efficient and mitigates vanishing gradients.
  - Variants like Leaky ReLU, Parametric ReLU, and GELU address ReLU’s limitations such as dying neurons.
- Industry adoption is extensive across sectors including finance, healthcare, and autonomous systems.
  - UK companies and research institutions integrate these functions into AI solutions, with notable activity in Manchester and Leeds AI hubs.
- Technical limitations persist:
  - Vanishing and exploding gradients remain challenges in very deep networks.
  - Activation functions can affect convergence speed and model generalisation.
- Frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and ONNX standardise activation function implementations, ensuring interoperability and optimisation.
