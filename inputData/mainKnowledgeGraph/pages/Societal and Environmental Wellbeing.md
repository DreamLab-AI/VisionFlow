## Societal and Environmental Wellbeing

Societal and Environmental Wellbeing refers to societal and environmental wellbeing is a trustworthiness dimension ensuring ai systems consider broader impacts on communities, environment, democratic processes, and human flourishing beyond immediate functional objectives, promoting sustainable development and social cohesion. this dimension encompasses four core components: environmental sustainability (measuring and minimizing energy consumption and carbon footprint throughout ai lifecycle including training and inference, implementing resource efficiency through techniques like model pruning, quantization, and distillation reducing computational requirements, supporting circular economy principles through hardware reuse and responsible disposal, and utilizing renewable energy sources and carbon-aware scheduling), social impact assessment (evaluating employment effects including job displacement risks, transformation of work roles, and creation of new opportunities, assessing skills impact and reskilling requirements as automation changes workforce needs, evaluating democratic impact on civic participation, information ecosystems, and governance processes, and considering social cohesion effects on community bonds, inequality, and societal polarization), societal benefit and contribution (aligning with public good objectives including health, education, and environmental protection, promoting human flourishing through capabilities enhancement and wellbeing improvement, and contributing to un sustainable development goals including sdg 3 health, sdg 4 education, sdg 5 gender equality, sdg 8 decent work, sdg 9 innovation, sdg 10 reduced inequalities, sdg 11 sustainable cities, sdg 12 responsible consumption, sdg 13 climate action, sdg 16 peace and justice, and sdg 17 partnerships), and accountability mechanisms (ensuring auditability through comprehensive documentation enabling external review, implementing risk management processes identifying and mitigating potential harms, providing redress mechanisms enabling affected parties to contest decisions, and assigning clear responsibility for outcomes to accountable parties). the 2024-2025 period witnessed environmental impact become critical concern as data centers consumed approximately 415 twh in 2024 with projections to reach 945 twh by 2030, generative ai training clusters consuming seven to eight times more energy than typical workloads, spurring green ai movement emphasizing algorithmic efficiency, energy-efficient hardware, and training optimization, while corporate leaders like google demonstrated viability of efficiency gains reducing data center emissions 12% despite 27% electricity consumption increase through delivering six times more computing power per unit electricity than five years prior, and u.s. lawmakers introduced artificial intelligence environmental impacts act directing epa environmental footprint studies.

- Societal and Environmental Wellbeing is increasingly embedded in policy and practice globally, with frameworks aligning to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
  - Organisations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) promote wellbeing as a resource for resilient, sustainable communities, integrating health, social, economic, and environmental dimensions[2][6].
  - In the UK, public health and environmental agencies incorporate wellbeing metrics into community planning and sustainability initiatives.
  - Technical capabilities include sophisticated measurement tools for subjective wellbeing (OECD guidelines, 2025) and resource-use impact models that reveal nonlinear relationships between resource consumption and wellbeing[5][8].
  - Limitations remain in operationalising wellbeing across diverse populations and balancing short-term needs with long-term sustainability[3].

    - Foundational theory on capabilities and freedoms essential to wellbeing[3].
- Ongoing research explores integrating subjective wellbeing measures with ecological impact assessments and developing regionally tailored wellbeing frameworks.

## UK Context

- The UK government and NGOs increasingly prioritise wellbeing in policy, notably through the Office for National Statistics’ wellbeing indicators and local sustainability programmes.
- North England cities such as Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Sheffield serve as innovation hubs for integrating societal and environmental wellbeing into urban regeneration and public health strategies.
  - For example, Manchester’s Green City initiatives combine environmental sustainability with social inclusion to enhance community wellbeing.
  - Leeds has pioneered community-led wellbeing projects focusing on equitable access to green spaces and health services.
- Regional case studies highlight the challenge of balancing industrial legacies with contemporary sustainability goals, often requiring creative, community-centred solutions.

## Future Directions

- Emerging trends include:
  - Greater integration of digital technologies to monitor and promote wellbeing while mitigating digital harms.
  - Development of adaptive, locally nuanced wellbeing frameworks that respond to social and ecological changes.
  - Increasing emphasis on the eudaimonic aspects of wellbeing—meaning, purpose, and flourishing beyond material consumption[5].
- Anticipated challenges:
  - Addressing inequalities that affect access to wellbeing resources.
  - Reconciling economic growth imperatives with planetary boundaries.
  - Ensuring policy coherence across sectors and scales.
- Research priorities focus on refining measurement tools, understanding wellbeing dynamics in diverse contexts, and designing interventions that are both effective and ethically grounded.
