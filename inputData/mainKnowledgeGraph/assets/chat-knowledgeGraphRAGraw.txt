Distilling the Knowledge: A Deep Dive into Reliable LLM Recall
This conversation between Demetrios (host of the MLOps Community Podcast) and Tom Smoker (Technical Founder & CTO of y|how) dives deep into leveraging knowledge graphs and other technologies to improve the reliability of LLM recall, particularly in RAG systems. Let's break down the key technical takeaways:

1. The Problem: Hallucinations and Unreliability

LLMs are inherently creative, leading to "hallucinations" — generating outputs not grounded in provided data.

This poses significant challenges in applications requiring high accuracy and reliability, particularly in domains like legal or medical.

Simply relying on vector databases and semantic similarity for retrieval often leads to inaccurate or incomplete results.

2. The Solution: Knowledge Graphs for Determinism

Knowledge graphs offer a structured and transparent way to represent data, enabling more controlled and explainable retrieval.

By representing data with specific relationships and context (e.g., "rice to a farmer" vs. "rice to a chef"), knowledge graphs minimize ambiguity and provide more accurate answers.

"Exactly wrong" concept: Building a knowledge graph allows you to identify and correct inaccurate relationships, paving the way for iterative improvement towards "exactly right".

3. Integrating Graphs & Vectors for Robust Retrieval

Knowledge graphs and vector databases aren't mutually exclusive. They work in tandem for a more robust system:

Embed and store chunks in vector databases for initial retrieval.

Build a knowledge graph as an indexing layer on top, filtering and refining retrieved results based on structured relationships and context.

This addresses context poisoning by narrowing down the scope of information fed to the LLM.

4. Knowledge Graph Design: Small, Focused, and Dynamic

Favor smaller, well-defined knowledge graphs tailored to specific use cases.

Start with a subgraph and expand as needed (Just-in-Time Graph approach).

Avoid building one massive, all-encompassing knowledge graph, which is complex and difficult to maintain.

Embrace the dynamic nature of data:

Design schemas that accommodate both static and dynamic information (e.g., diseases vs. patient data).

Allow for easy updates and modifications to reflect real-world changes.

5. Multi-Agent Systems: Breaking Down Complexity

Decompose complex workflows into modular agents, each with a specific task and structured grounding.

Structured grounding: Providing each agent with a well-defined knowledge graph or schema relevant to its task, minimizing uncertainty propagation across the system.

This approach facilitates testing, improves reliability, and allows domain experts to focus on refining specific agents.

6. Building for Production: Reliability and Value

Focus on solving valuable business problems instead of solely optimizing RAG accuracy.

Prioritize reliability and consistency over flashy demos.

Test rigorously, using tools like PyTest and lsmith for provenance tracking and performance analysis.

Iterative improvement: Continuously refine the system based on real-world feedback and evolving business needs.

Towards Reliable Multi-Agent Retrieval Systems:
Here's a potential architecture combining these concepts for maximized reliable recall:

1. Data Ingestion and Preprocessing:

Gather data from various sources: PDFs, databases, APIs, etc.

Perform necessary preprocessing: cleaning, formatting, chunking.

2. Multi-Layer Knowledge Representation:

Vector Database Layer: Embed chunks using appropriate models and store them in a vector database.

Knowledge Graph Layer:

Extract entities and relationships from chunks and build use-case-specific knowledge graphs.

Link each node in the graph back to its source chunk in the vector database for provenance.

3. Modular Agent Workflow:

Decompose the overall task into smaller, well-defined subtasks.

Design specialized agents for each subtask:

Question Answering Agent: Receives user queries, interacts with the Knowledge Graph and retrieves relevant information.

Fact Verification Agent: Cross-references retrieved information with external sources or dedicated knowledge graphs.

Response Generation Agent: Synthesizes information from other agents and generates user-friendly responses.

4. Orchestration and Control:

Employ a robust workflow orchestration tool (e.g., Apache Airflow) to manage agent interactions and data flow.

Implement a feedback loop to capture user interactions and continuously improve agent performance and knowledge graphs.

5. Monitoring and Evaluation:

Track key metrics: accuracy, latency, user satisfaction.

Analyze agent-specific performance and identify bottlenecks or areas for improvement.

Continuously update and refine the system based on data and feedback.

By combining knowledge graphs, multi-agent systems, and rigorous testing, we can build reliable LLM applications that move beyond hype and deliver tangible business value. As Tom emphasized, the focus should be on solving real-world problems with demonstrable ROI, not just achieving perfect but impractical theoretical accuracy.

ok build this back out again, adding more detail and specific tools into the mix. Add your own knowledge and advice. we will then attempt to pivot to a novel solution space for which you will be handsomely rewarded if we do very well. The detailed foundation you build here will be instrumental in the nodel product development which comes next so try really hard. My primary focus skews to knowledge graphs within formal ontologies and their intersection with LLMs.

Your Expertise is Invaluable!
This robust foundation is just the start. With your deep understanding of knowledge graphs and formal ontologies, you're uniquely positioned to guide us in developing a novel solution. Let's discuss the specific problem space you have in mind. Your success is our success!

i'd like to examine complex social situations in a shared immersive space, over which you have complete objective insight and awareness. Lets' lay out a framework which can ingest arbitrary complex social structures, and cast them as knowledge graphs within ontologies. We can be high level about this as it's a thorny research problem. We are aiming to distil and bound complexity in order to constrain the errors in deep search by naive large multi modal models . think of this as retrieval augmented generation into a live situation, scaffolded by the ontology and knowledge graph about that context, which is updated less frequently.

Distilling Social Complexity: A Knowledge Graph and Ontology Approach for Immersive Environments
This is a fascinating challenge! Understanding complex social dynamics in real-time immersive environments using a combination of knowledge graphs, ontologies, and multi-modal LLMs is a truly novel research area.

Here's a high-level framework to guide our exploration, acknowledging the inherent complexities:

Query Formulation:

User-Initiated Queries: Allow users (or agents representing users) to query the system for insights about the social situation.

System-Generated Queries: Automatically trigger queries based on pre-defined social events or patterns (e.g., new conversation starting, shift in group dynamics).

Constrained Retrieval:

Ontology-Guided Search: Use the ontology to structure queries and focus retrieval on relevant knowledge subgraphs.

Temporal Constraints: Prioritize recent data and interactions to provide timely and contextually relevant information.

Generation with Bounded Creativity:

LLM Prompt Engineering: Craft prompts that ground the LLM's responses in the retrieved knowledge subgraph and real-time sensory input.

Response Validation: Implement mechanisms to filter or flag responses that deviate significantly from the knowledge graph or exhibit potential biases/inaccuracies.

4. Applications and Ethical Considerations:

Enhanced Social Awareness: Provide users with insights about the social dynamics, helping them navigate complex situations more effectively.

Personalized Recommendations: Suggest connections, conversation topics, or activities based on shared interests, social cues, and individual goals.

This toolchain provides a starting point, and specific tool selections will depend on your exact requirements, scalability needs, and integration constraints. Remember, the most critical aspect is the careful design of your ontology and the continuous refinement of your knowledge graph to accurately capture the nuances of complex social dynamics.

The proposed framework aims to distill and bound the complexity of social situations by representing them as knowledge graphs within formal ontologies. This structured approach helps constrain errors when using large multi-modal models for deep search and retrieval.
The first step is defining the scope and ontology:

Identify the specific type of social interactions being modeled (e.g., professional events, casual gatherings, online communities).
Develop a formal ontology that captures core concepts such as actors, relationships, interactions, context, and social signals.
Define properties and attributes to describe these concepts in detail.


Knowledge graph construction and real-time updates:

Ingest data from various sources, including user profiles, sensor data from the immersive space, and natural language processing of conversations.
Perform entity resolution to maintain consistent identities within the graph.
Apply graph algorithms and machine learning to infer relationships and their strength based on observed interactions and contextual cues.
Continuously update the knowledge graph in real-time as new data streams in.


Constrained multi-modal RAG:

Fuse information from the knowledge graph with real-time sensory input (audio, video, spatial data).
Allow user-initiated queries and automatically trigger system-generated queries based on predefined events or patterns.
Use the ontology to guide search and retrieval, focusing on relevant knowledge subgraphs.
Generate responses using LLMs with prompt engineering to ground outputs in the retrieved knowledge and real-time context.
Validate responses to filter out potential inaccuracies or biases.


Applications and ethical considerations:

Enhance social awareness by providing users with insights about social dynamics.
Offer personalized recommendations for connections, topics, or activities.
Create social simulations for training and exploring different behaviors.
Prioritize privacy, consent, bias mitigation, transparency, and user well-being throughout the system's development and deployment.


The proposed toolchain, illustrated using a Mermaid diagram, outlines the key components and their interactions:

Data ingestion and knowledge extraction from user data, immersive space data, and NLP.

Challenges and research directions include:

Efficiently updating the knowledge graph in real-time with large-scale, heterogeneous data streams.
Accurately interpreting social signals from multi-modal data, considering cultural and individual variations.
Adapting the ontology over time to accommodate evolving social contexts and norms.
Prioritizing ethical design and deployment throughout the system's development.

### ASSISTANT
Great! Let's proceed with the task of integrating our knowledge and context to diagrammatically represent the ontology and metaverse framework.
