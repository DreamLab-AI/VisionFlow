However, many of the present approaches of interactive distributed visualization are based on the traditional polygonal processing graphics pipeline. Our research is centred on investigating an alternative method using image-based rendering (IBR) which uses (multiple) images of the scene instead of a 3D geometrical representation. A key advantage to the use of IBR techniques is that the bandwidth required is independent of scene complexity and is therefore predictable given knowledge of the desired final image resolution. In this paper, we describe our IBR based interactive distributed visualization platform involving light field rendering and present results which indicate the scalability of our approach to accommodate multiple collaborative users.

The proposed distribution scheme ensures scalability of the system and hereby allows control over the number of cameras used for acquisition, the frame-rate, or the number of projectors used for high resolution visualization.

Meetings are a workplace activity that deserves increased attention from researchers and practitioners. Previous researchers attempted to develop typologies of meeting purpose with limited success. Through a comparison of classification methodologies, the authors consider a taxonomy as the appropriate classification scheme for meeting purpose. The authors then utilize the developed taxonomy to investigate the frequency with which a representative sample of working adults engaged in meetings of these varying purposes. Their proposed taxonomy provides relevant classifications for future research on meetings as well and serves as a useful tool for managers seeking to use and evaluate the effectiveness of meetings within their organizations. Design/methodology/approach– This study employs an inductive methodology using discourse analysis of qualitative meeting descriptions to develop a taxonomy of meeting purpose. The authors discourse analysis utilizes open-ended survey responses from a sample of working adults (n = 491). Findings– The authors categorical analysis of open-ended questions resulted in a 16-category taxonomy of meeting purpose. The two most prevalent meeting purpose categories in this sample were “to discuss ongoing projects” at 11.6 per cent and “to routinely discuss the state of the business” at 10.8 per cent. The two least common meeting purpose categories in this sample were “to brainstorm for ideas or solutions” at 3.3 per cent and “to discuss productivity and efficiencies” at 3.7 per cent. The taxonomy was analyzed across organizational type and employee job level to identify differences between those important organizational and employee characteristics. Research limitations/implications– The data suggested that meetings were institutionalized in organizations, making them useful at identifying differences between organizations as well as differences in employees in terms of scope of responsibility. Researchers and managers should consider the purposes for which they call meetings and how that manifests their overarching organizational focus, structure and goals. Originality/value– This is the first study to overtly attempt to categorize the various purposes for which meetings are held. Further, this study develops a taxonomy of meeting purposes that will prove useful for investigating the different types of meeting purposes in a broad range of organizational types and structures."],"author":["Allen Joseph, A","Beck, Tammy","Scott Cliff, W","Rogelberg Steven, G"],"journal":["Management Research Review"],"keywords":["litsurvey.bib"],"month":["#jan#"],"number":[9],"pages":["791–814"],"publisher":["Emerald Group Publishing Limited"],"title":["Understanding workplace meetings: A qualitative taxonomy of meeting purposes"],"volume":[37],"year":[2014]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Allen Joseph","firstName":"A"},{"lastName":"Beck","firstName":"Tammy"},{"lastName":"Scott Cliff","firstName":"W"},{"lastName":"Rogelberg Steven","firstName":"G"}]}},{"key":"Alspaugh2018","type":"article","fields":{"author":["Alspaugh, Sara","Zokaei, Nava","Liu, Andrea","Jin, Cindy","Hearst, Marti A"],"file":[":C\\:/Users/its352/Google Drive/DataVis/literature\\_repository/Data Visualisation/08440815.pdf:PDF"],"journal":["IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics"],"number":[1],"pages":["22–31"],"publisher":["IEEE"],"title":["Futzing and moseying: Interviews with professional data analysts on exploration practices"],"volume":[25],"year":[2018]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Alspaugh","firstName":"Sara"},{"lastName":"Zokaei","firstName":"Nava"},{"lastName":"Liu","firstName":"Andrea"},{"lastName":"Jin","firstName":"Cindy"},{"lastName":"Hearst","firstName":"Marti A"}]}},{"key":"ammous2018bitcoin","type":"book","fields":{"author":["Ammous, Saifedean"],"file":[":../../../literature\\_repository/bitcoin/The Bitcoin Standard.pdf:PDF"],"publisher":["John Wiley & Sons"],"title":["The bitcoin standard: the decentralized alternative to central banking"],"year":[2018]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Ammous","firstName":"Saifedean"}]}},{"key":"oxford2021salvador","type":"article","fields":{"author":["Oxford Analytica"],"journal":["Emerald Expert Briefings"],"number":["oxan-db"],"publisher":["Oxford Analytica"],"title":["El Salvador bitcoin experiment comes with risks"],"year":[2021]},"creators":{"author":[{"firstName":"Oxford","lastName":"Analytica"}]}},{"key":"Andersen2019","type":"inproceedings","fields":{"author":["Andersen, Benjamin JH","Davis, Arran TA","Weber, Gerald","Wünsche, Burkhard C"],"booktitle":["2019 international conference on electronics, information, and communication (ICEIC)"],"file":[":C\\:/Users/its352/Google Drive/DataVis/literature\\_repository/Data Visualisation/08706403.pdf:PDF"],"organization":["IEEE"],"pages":["1–7"],"title":["Immersion or diversion: Does virtual reality make data visualisation more effective?"],"year":[2019]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Andersen","firstName":"Benjamin JH"},{"lastName":"Davis","firstName":"Arran TA"},{"lastName":"Weber","firstName":"Gerald"},{"lastName":"Wünsche","firstName":"Burkhard C"}]},"sentenceCased":true},{"key":"Anstis1969","type":"inproceedings","fields":{"author":["Anstis, Stuart M","Mayhew, John W","Morley, Tania"],"keywords":["litsurvey.bib"],"pages":["474–489"],"publisher":["JSTOR"],"title":["The perception of where a face or television portrait is looking"],"volume":[82],"year":[1969]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Anstis","firstName":"Stuart M"},{"lastName":"Mayhew","firstName":"John W"},{"lastName":"Morley","firstName":"Tania"}]},"sentenceCased":true},{"key":"Antley2014-en","type":"phdthesis","fields":{"author":["Antley, Angus"],"keywords":["litsurvey.bib"],"school":["UCL (University College London)"],"title":["Human balance behaviour in immersive virtual environments"],"year":[2014]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Antley","firstName":"Angus"}]},"sentenceCased":true},{"key":"antonopoulos2017mastering","type":"book","fields":{"author":["Antonopoulos, Andreas M"],"file":[":../../../literature\\_repository/bitcoin/Mastering-bitcoin-2nd.pdf:PDF"],"publisher":["\" O'Reilly Media, Inc.\""],"title":["Mastering bitcoin: Programming the open blockchain"],"year":[2017]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Antonopoulos","firstName":"Andreas M"}]},"sentenceCased":true},{"key":"Aoki2003","type":"inproceedings","fields":{"address":["New York, NY, USA"],"author":["Aoki, Paul M","Romaine, Matthew","Szymanski, Margaret H","Thornton, James D","Wilson, Daniel","Woodruff, Allison"],"booktitle":["Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on human factors in computing systems"],"institution":["ACM"],"keywords":["floor management","audio space","conversation analysis","litsurvey.bib"],"location":["Ft.

The system is compact in terms of number of computers, and provides superior image quality, resolution and frame rate compared to other published systems. To generate light-field content, we have built a camera system with a large number of cameras and connected them to PC computers. The cameras were in an evenly spaced linear arrangement. The capture PC was directly connected through a single gigabit Ethernet connection to the demonstration 3D display, supported by a PC computation cluster. For the task of dense light field displaying massively parallel reordering and filtering of the original camera images is required. We were utilizing both CPU and GPU threads for this task.

In this paper we describe an empirical study that attempts to plot Mori's hypothesized curve. In addition, the influence of framing on the users' perception of the stimuli was investigated. Framing had no significant influence on the measurements. The pictures of robots and humans were rated independently of whether the participants knew a particular picture showed a robot or human.

We test our model using an archival field methodology and multiple-source data (qualitative and quantitative) from 76 workgroups in a Fortune 500 information-processing company. Our results revealed that groups with social category faultlines had low team discretionary awards. Faultline distance further exacerbated the negative effects of strength in groups with social category faultlines and produced similarly negative effects in groups with information-based faultlines.

Such three-dimensional (3D) images, or holograms, can be seen with the unassisted eye and are very similar to how humans see the actual environment surrounding them. The concept of 3D telepresence, a real-time dynamic hologram depicting a scene occurring in a different location, has attracted considerable public interest since it was depicted in the original Star Wars film in 1977. However, the lack of sufficient computational power to produce realistic computer-generated holograms and the absence of large-area and dynamically updatable holographic recording media have prevented realization of the concept. Here we use a holographic stereographic technique and a photorefractive polymer material as the recording medium to demonstrate a holographic display that can refresh images every two seconds. A 50ÄâHz nanosecond pulsed laser is used to write the holographic pixels. Multicoloured holographic 3D images are produced by using angular multiplexing, and the full parallax display employs spatial multiplexing. 3D telepresence is demonstrated by taking multiple images from one location and transmitting the information via Ethernet to another location where the hologram is printed with the quasi-real-time dynamic 3D display. Further improvements could bring applications in telemedicine, prototyping, advertising, updatable 3D maps and entertainment."],"author":["Blanche, P-A","Bablumian, A","Voorakaranam, R","Christenson, C","Lin, W","Gu, T","Flores, D","Wang, P","Hsieh, W-Y","Kathaperumal, M","Rachwal, B","Siddiqui, O","Thomas, J","Norwood, R a","Yamamoto, M","Peyghambarian, N"],"keywords":["litsurvey.bib"],"pages":["80–83"],"title":["Holographic three-dimensional telepresence using large-area photorefractive polymer"],"volume":[468],"year":[2010]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Blanche","firstName":"P-A"},{"lastName":"Bablumian","firstName":"A"},{"lastName":"Voorakaranam","firstName":"R"},{"lastName":"Christenson","firstName":"C"},{"lastName":"Lin","firstName":"W"},{"lastName":"Gu","firstName":"T"},{"lastName":"Flores","firstName":"D"},{"lastName":"Wang","firstName":"P"},{"lastName":"Hsieh","firstName":"W-Y"},{"lastName":"Kathaperumal","firstName":"M"},{"lastName":"Rachwal","firstName":"B"},{"lastName":"Siddiqui","firstName":"O"},{"lastName":"Thomas","firstName":"J"},{"lastName":"Norwood","firstName":"R a"},{"lastName":"Yamamoto","firstName":"M"},{"lastName":"Peyghambarian","firstName":"N"}]}},{"key":"Blandford2008","type":"inproceedings","fields":{"author":["Blandford, Ann","Cox, Anna","Cairns, Paul"],"keywords":["litsurvey.bib"],"title":["Controlled experiments"],"year":[2008]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Blandford","firstName":"Ann"},{"lastName":"Cox","firstName":"Anna"},{"lastName":"Cairns","firstName":"Paul"}]},"sentenceCased":true},{"key":"Blascovich2002","type":"inproceedings","fields":{"address":["New York, NY, USA"],"author":["Blascovich, Jim"],"booktitle":["Proceedings of the 4th international conference on Collaborative virtual environments"],"keywords":["agency","behavioral realism","self-relevance","social influence","litsurvey.bib"],"location":["Bonn, Germany"],"month":["#sep#"],"pages":["25–30"],"publisher":["Association for Computing Machinery"],"series":["CVE '02"],"title":["A theoretical model of social influence for increasing the utility of collaborative virtual environments"],"year":[2002]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Blascovich","firstName":"Jim"}]}},{"key":"Bloom2015","type":"article","fields":{"author":["Bloom, Nicholas","Liang, James","Roberts, John","Ying, Zhichun Jenny"],"journal":["Q.

An individual speaking with a woman tends to nod his or her head more than when speaking with a man. Is this due to social expectation or due to coupled motion dynamics between the speakers? We present a novel methodology that allows us to randomly assign apparent identity during free conversation in a video-conference, thereby dissociating apparent sex from motion dynamics. The method uses motion-tracked synthesized avatars that are accepted by naive participants as being live video. We find that 1) motion dynamics affect head movements but that apparent sex does not; 2) judgments of sex are driven almost entirely by appearance; and 3) ratings of masculinity and femininity rely on a combination of both appearance and dynamics. Together, these findings are consistent with the hypothesis of separate perceptual streams for appearance and biological motion. In addition, our results are consistent with a view that head movements in conversation form a low level perception and action system that can operate independently from top-down social expectations."],"author":["Boker, Steven M","Cohn, Jeffrey F","Theobald, Barry-John","Matthews, Iain","Mangini, Michael","Spies, Jeffrey R","Ambadar, Zara","Brick, Timothy R"],"journal":["J.

This paper discusses the strength of four existing models describing communications media use in individuals and organizations. The paper also presents research which evaluated interactions of multiple situation variables affecting communications media appropriateness in a survey population. Participants rated die acceptability of each of twelve communications media in each of eight hypothetical organizational situations. Situations varied based on high or low levels of three factors: message urgency, amount of message content, and distance between communicators. Results indicated (1) situations have unique and significant contributions to media appropriateness; (2) appropriateness of media usage depends on the match between situation requirements and media characteristics, and (3) situation effects are more salient in some ?situation-dependent? media. Another survey of 1072 voice mail users confirmed die validity and reliability of these results."],"author":["Caldwell, Barrett S","Uang, Shiaw-Tsyr","Taha, Lilas H"],"journal":["Behav. Inf.

Together these two facets of social cognition create one of the most influential and important social sciences to come along in some time. Providing a comprehensive review of major topics in the field of social cognition, The Oxford Handbook of Social Cognition expresses that excitement and fascination in describing the content and approach that constitute the field today. The 43 chapters included in this handbook cover: - central aspects of the field of social cognition, including its history and historically important foundational research areas (attribution, attitudes, impression formation, and prejudice/stereotyping), along with methodology - core issues relating to social cognitive representations and processes (including those that are visual, implicit, or automatic) and the stages of information processing (attention, perception, memory, and judgment, along with simulation and thought suppression) - applications of the social cognition approach to areas of social psychology, general psychology, and other disciplines, such as marketing, law, health and politics After more than 30 years, the vibrant field of social cognition continues to reign as one of psychology's most dominant approaches.

In this study, we propose a scheme to generate an octree of an object from its three orthogonal views (silhouettes) exploiting a volume intersection technique. A multi-level boundary search algorithm is developed to incorporate surface information into the octree representation. This makes the octree representation compact, informative, and especially useful for graphic displays and object recognition tasks. An algorithm is also designed for computing the moment of inertia matrix, which is useful for object recognition.

Therefore an open standard, OpenCL, is proposed to provide universal APIs and programming paradigms for various GPUs and accelerators. In this study, it adopts several benchmarks, with various computation characteristics, to demonstrate the capabilities of OpenCL with several platforms. These programs are parallelized by OpenMP and OpenCL, and then targeted on several GPUs and conventional servers. This paper also provides an example to illustrate the migration of the given program, from OpenMP to OpenCL.

It is concluded that gaze is one of the main nonverbal signals and that knowledge of its uses has important practical implications for treatment and training in social skills and for the design of communications equipment.

Given the video streams acquired by two cameras placed on either side of a computer monitor, the proposed algorithm synthesizes images from a virtual camera in arbitrary position (typically located within the monitor) to facilitate eye contact. Our technique is based on an improved, dynamic-programming, stereo algorithm for efficient novel-view generation. The two main contributions are: i) a new type of three-plane graph for dense-stereo dynamic-programming, that encourages correct occlusion labeling; ii) a compact geometric derivation for novel-view synthesis by direct projection of the minimum-cost surface. Furthermore, we present a novel algorithm for the temporal maintenance of a background model to enhance the rendering of occlusions and reduce temporal artefacts (flicker); and a cost aggregation algorithm that acts directly on our three-dimensional matching cost space. Examples are given that demonstrate the robustness of the new algorithm to spatial and temporal artefacts for long stereo video streams. These include demonstrations of synthesis of cyclopean views of extended conversational sequences.

It focusses on the lessons we can learn from extended, long-term use of media spaces, with connections that last not hours or days, but months or years. We take as our starting point a set of assumptions which differ from traditional analytical perspectives. In particular, we begin from the position that that real-world baseline is not always an appropriate point of comparison for new media technologies; that a set of complex and intricate communicative behaviours arise over time; and that media spaces connect not only individuals, but the wider social groups of which they form part. We outline a framework based on four perspectives — individual, interactional, communal and societal — from which to view the behaviour of individuals and groups linked by multimedia environments. On the basis of our long-term findings, we argue for a view of media spaces which, first, focuses on a wider interpretation of media space interaction than the traditional view of person-to-person connections, and, second, emphasises emergent communicative practices, rather than looking for the transfer of face-to-face behaviours."],"author":["Dourish, Paul","Adler, Annette","Bellotti, Victoria","Henderson, Austin"],"journal":["Comput.

These faces can be used as well-controlled, realistic and dynamic stimuli in emotion research. However, the validity of virtual facial expressions in comparison to natural emotion displays still needs to be shown for the different emotions and different age groups. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Thirty-two healthy volunteers between the age of 20 and 60 rated pictures of natural human faces and faces of virtual characters (avatars) with respect to the expressed emotions: happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and neutral. Results indicate that virtual emotions were recognized comparable to natural ones. Recognition differences in virtual and natural faces depended on specific emotions: whereas disgust was difficult to convey with the current avatar technology, virtual sadness and fear achieved better recognition results than natural faces. Furthermore, emotion recognition rates decreased for virtual but not natural faces in participants over the age of 40. This specific age effect suggests that media exposure has an influence on emotion recognition. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Virtual and natural facial displays of emotion may be equally effective. Improved technology (e.g. better modelling of the naso-labial area) may lead to even better results as compared to trained actors. Due to the ease with which virtual human faces can be animated and manipulated, validated artificial emotional expressions will be of major relevance in future research and therapeutic applications."],"author":["Dyck, Miriam","Winbeck, Maren","Leiberg, Susanne","Chen, Yuhan","Gur, Ruben C","Mathiak, Klaus"],"journal":["PLoS One"],"keywords":["litsurvey.bib"],"month":["#nov#"],"number":[11],"pages":["e3628"],"publisher":["Public Library of Science"],"title":["Recognition profile of emotions in natural and virtual faces"],"volume":[3],"year":[2008]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Dyck","firstName":"Miriam"},{"lastName":"Winbeck","firstName":"Maren"},{"lastName":"Leiberg","firstName":"Susanne"},{"lastName":"Chen","firstName":"Yuhan"},{"lastName":"Gur","firstName":"Ruben C"},{"lastName":"Mathiak","firstName":"Klaus"}]}},{"key":"Edigo1988","type":"inproceedings","fields":{"author":["Edigo, C"],"booktitle":["Proceedings of the ACM conf. on Computer-Supported cooperative work"],"keywords":["litsurvey.bib"],"title":["Videoconferencing as a technology to support group work: A review of its failure"],"year":[1988]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Edigo","firstName":"C"}]},"sentenceCased":true},{"key":"egger2017htc","type":"article","fields":{"author":["Egger, Jan","Gall, Markus","Wallner, Jürgen","Boechat, Pedro","Hann, Alexander","Li, Xing","Chen, Xiaojun","Schmalstieg, Dieter"],"file":[":C\\:/Users/its352/Google Drive/DataVis/literature\\_repository/Data Mining/volumeMedical/pone.0173972.pdf:PDF"],"journal":["PloS one"],"number":[3],"pages":["e0173972"],"publisher":["Public Library of Science"],"title":["HTC Vive MeVisLab integration via OpenVR for medical applications"],"volume":[12],"year":[2017]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Egger","firstName":"Jan"},{"lastName":"Gall","firstName":"Markus"},{"lastName":"Wallner","firstName":"Jürgen"},{"lastName":"Boechat","firstName":"Pedro"},{"lastName":"Hann","firstName":"Alexander"},{"lastName":"Li","firstName":"Xing"},{"lastName":"Chen","firstName":"Xiaojun"},{"lastName":"Schmalstieg","firstName":"Dieter"}]}},{"key":"Ehsan2017","type":"article","fields":{"author":["Ehsan, Humaira","Sharaf, Mohamed A","Chrysanthis, Panos K"],"file":[":C\\:/Users/its352/Google Drive/DataVis/literature\\_repository/Data Visualisation/08081825.pdf:PDF"],"journal":["IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering"],"number":[2],"pages":["263–277"],"publisher":["IEEE"],"title":["Efficient recommendation of aggregate data visualizations"],"volume":[30],"year":[2017]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Ehsan","firstName":"Humaira"},{"lastName":"Sharaf","firstName":"Mohamed A"},{"lastName":"Chrysanthis","firstName":"Panos K"}]}},{"key":"Van_Eijk2010","type":"inproceedings","fields":{"abstract":["Gaze awareness and eye contact serve important functions in social interaction.

Our results indicate that the disparity between the optical axis of the camera and the looking direction of a looker (a photographed face) should be at most 1.2° in horizontal direction, and 1.7° in vertical direction to support eye contact. Maximum tolerable offsets for the perception of eye contact are independent of (monoscopic or stereoscopic) display conditions.

The purpose of this paper is to elaborate on the potential impact of one critical design aspect of meetings – namely, whether a decision to be taken (or the meeting in general) was scheduled or not – on the use of distributed information, information elaboration, conflict, speed of decision making, and, ultimately, decision-making effectiveness. Design/methodology/approach– The research presented in this paper combines a literature review with empirical data obtained from questionnaires and direct observation of decision making meetings on organisational issues in a hospital. One meeting was scheduled, the other two were unscheduled. A second questionnaire was administered 12 months after the respective decision making meetings to explore and evaluate the efficiency of the decisions made and their implementation. Findings– This paper suggests that a scheduled meeting with a shared agenda of all decisions to be taken may induce decision makers to form opinions upfront at the meeting, with these opinions eventually serving as sources of conflict during group discussion. Because of the nature of the conflict generated, these meetings are more likely to run long and to not deliver the expected outcomes. Originality/value– The study contributes to the debate on group decision-making processes by examining the effect of meeting scheduling on information elaboration and conflict in real-world decision-making settings. Although robust evidence has supported the existence of relationships between information elaboration, conflict, and decision-making effectiveness, previous studies have mainly focused on the effects of these processes during scheduled meetings and experimental settings. The findings of the present study show the effect of meeting scheduling on decision-making effectiveness in real-world settings."],"author":["Eisenbart, Boris","Garbuio, Massimo","Mascia, Daniele","Morandi, Federica"],"journal":["Journal of Strategy and Management"],"keywords":["litsurvey.bib"],"month":["#jan#"],"number":[1],"pages":["15–38"],"publisher":["Emerald Group Publishing Limited"],"title":["Does scheduling matter?

Specifically, the system integrates continuous visual odometry computation with tracking-by-detection in order to track pedestrians in spite of frequent occlusions and egomotion of the camera rig. To achieve reliable performance under real-world conditions, it has long been advocated to extract and combine as much visual information as possible. We propose a way to closely integrate the vision modules for visual odometry, pedestrian detection, depth estimation, and tracking. The integration naturally leads to several cognitive feedback loops between the modules. Among others, we propose a novel feedback connection from the object detector to visual odometry which utilizes the semantic knowledge of detection to stabilize localization. Feedback loops always carry the danger that erroneous feedback from one module is amplified and causes the entire system to become instable. We therefore incorporate automatic failure detection and recovery, allowing the system to continue when a module becomes unreliable. The approach is experimentally evaluated on several long and difficult video sequences from busy inner-city locations. Our results show that the proposed integration makes it possible to deliver stable tracking performance in scenes of previously infeasible complexity."],"author":["Ess, A","Leibe, B","Schindler, K","Van Gool, L"],"booktitle":["2008 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition"],"keywords":["computer vision","feedback","image sequences","tracking","video signal processing","mobile vision system","multiperson tracking","continuous visual odometry computation","tracking-by-detection","pedestrian tracking","egomotion","camera rig","pedestrian detection","depth estimation","cognitive feedback loops","automatic failure detection","video sequences","Machine vision","Layout","Feedback loop","Object detection","Mobile robots","Noise robustness","Cameras","Data mining","Detectors","Video sequences","litsurvey.bib"],"month":["#jun#"],"pages":["1–8"],"title":["A mobile vision system for robust multi-person tracking"],"year":[2008]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Ess","firstName":"A"},{"lastName":"Leibe","firstName":"B"},{"lastName":"Schindler","firstName":"K"},{"lastName":"Van Gool","firstName":"L"}]},"sentenceCased":true},{"key":"Esteban2002","type":"article","fields":{"author":["Esteban, C H","Schmitt, F"],"journal":["International Symposium on 3D Processing, Visualization, and Transmission (3DPVT '02)"],"keywords":["litsurvey.bib"],"pages":["159–166"],"title":["Multi-stereo 3d object reconstruction"],"year":[2002]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Esteban","firstName":"C H"},{"lastName":"Schmitt","firstName":"F"}]}},{"key":"faccia2019accounting","type":"article","fields":{"author":["Faccia, Alessio","Mosteanu, Narcisa Roxana"],"journal":["The Business & Management Review"],"number":[2],"pages":["108–116"],"publisher":["Centre for Business & Economic Research"],"title":["Accounting and blockchain technology: from double-entry to triple-entry"],"volume":[10],"year":[2019]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Faccia","firstName":"Alessio"},{"lastName":"Mosteanu","firstName":"Narcisa Roxana"}]}},{"key":"Fagel2010","type":"inproceedings","fields":{"address":["New York, NY, USA"],"author":["Fagel, Sascha","Bailly, Gérard","Elisei, Frédéric","Lelong, Amélie"],"booktitle":["Proceedings of the 3rd international workshop on Affective interaction in natural environments"],"institution":["ACM"],"keywords":["face-to-face interaction","head motion","eye gaze","litsurvey.bib"],"location":["Firenze, Italy"],"month":["#oct#"],"pages":["81–86"],"publisher":["Association for Computing Machinery"],"series":["AFFINE '10"],"title":["On the importance of eye gaze in a face-to-face collaborative task"],"year":[2010]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Fagel","firstName":"Sascha"},{"lastName":"Bailly","firstName":"Gérard"},{"lastName":"Elisei","firstName":"Frédéric"},{"lastName":"Lelong","firstName":"Amélie"}]}},{"key":"Fairchild2017","type":"article","fields":{"abstract":["This paper presents a mixed reality (MR) system that results from the integration of a telepresence system and an application to improve collaborative space exploration.

A practical contribution is the demonstration of pragmatic approaches to sharing space between display systems of distinct levels of immersion.

Each device was tested three times in three different classrooms during an actual class with actual instructors (the subjects). A one-way analysis of variance demonstrated a significant difference in response time for the four devices with the yellow light and the metal hand being fastest.

A ?split-the-difference principle? is suggested to augment the usual theory, so as to specify the exact amount of payments to be made in an ordinary two-person bargaining situation such as the sale of a used car. The application of this principle seems satisfactory in the experiments. One experiment suggests that, in a sequence of trials in the same game situation, people tend to start near an equilibrium point and then try to find a better equilibrium, if there is one.

The model integrates two areas of research. One body of work posits that media use patterns are the outcome of objectively rational choices. These choices involve evaluating communication options and selecting an appropriate medium to match the communication requirements of the task. The second perspective is social information processing theory (Salancik & Pfeffer, 1978). This approach proposes that attitudes and behaviors are partially determined by information embedded in the social context. The synthesis of these perspectives asserts that media characteristics and attitudes are in part socially constructed. Furthermore, attitudes are influenced by attributions based on observations of one's own past behavior. This model is shown to explain a wider range of existing empirical findings. Also, new propositions are derived to guide future research. This social construction model of media use has significant implications for the design, conduct, and reporting of future research in organizations."],"author":["Fulk, Janet","Steinfield, Charles W","Schmitz, Joseph","Power, J Gerard"],"journal":["Communic.

In a face-to-face context mutual gaze has been shown to facilitate the encoding and subsequent recall of information [Fry, R., Smith, G.F., 1975. The effects of feedback and eye contact on performance of a digit-coding task. J. Soc. Psychol. 96, 145-146; Otteson, J.D., Otteson, C.R., 1980. Effect of teacher's gaze on children's story recall.

One explanation for these findings is that gaze acts as an arousal stimulus, which increases attentional focus and therefore enhances memory [Kelley, D.H., Gorham, J., 1988. Effects of immediacy on recall of information. Commun. Edu. 37(3), 198-207]. Two studies were conducted in order to test whether gazing at the camera during video-mediated presentations resulted in similar benefits as mutual gaze in a face-to-face context. In study 1 a confederate presented information about two fictitious soap products. In one condition, the confederate gazed at the camera for 30% of the presentation, therefore giving the participants the impression that he was gazing in their direction. In the other condition the confederate did not gaze at the camera. Participants viewed the sales presentations from both conditions. In the condition where gaze was directed at the camera, participants recalled significantly more information about the sales presentation. Study 2 employed the same pre-recorded sales presentations used in study 1, however they were delivered to the participants under audio-only conditions (therefore, the image was switched off). Results from study 2 indicated no recall differences between the two conditions. Findings from these studies would seem to indicate that the perception of gaze aversion over a video link (a consequence of the salesman not looking into the camera) has a negative impact on information recall. This has practical implications for video-mediated presentations. In a distance learning environment lecturers could be advised to look into the camera in order to promote more efficient learning in students."],"author":["Fullwood, Chris","Doherty-Sneddon, Gwyneth"],"journal":["Appl.

Despite being aware that the agents were computer-generated, participants with higher levels of social anxiety were significantly more likely to avoid ?disturbing? them. This suggests that on some level people can respond to virtual humans as social actors even in the absence of complex interaction. Responses appear to be shaped both by the agents' behaviors and by people's expectations of the technology.

Small group conversations are a specific case on which much of this work has been conducted.

The review is organized around the main themes studied in the literature and discusses, in a comparative fashion, about 100 works addressing problems related to the computational modeling of interaction management, internal states, personality traits, and social relationships in small group conversations, along with pointers to the relevant literature in social science.

Gesturing is a robust phenomenon, found across cultures, ages, and tasks. Gesture is even found in individuals blind from birth. But what purpose, if any, does gesture serve? In this review, I begin by examining gesture when it stands on its own, substituting for speech and clearly serving a communicative function. When called upon to carry the full burden of communication, gesture assumes a language-like form, with structure at word and sentence levels. However, when produced along with speech, gesture assumes a different form - it becomes imagistic and analog. Despite its form, the gesture that accompanies speech also communicates. Trained coders can glean substantive information from gesture - information that is not always identical to that gleaned from speech. Gesture can thus serve as a research tool, shedding light on speakers' unspoken thoughts. The controversial question is whether gesture conveys information to listeners not trained to read them. Do spontaneous gestures communicate to ordinary listeners? Or might they be produced only for speakers themselves? I suggest these are not mutually exclusive functions - gesture serves as both a tool for communication for listeners, and a tool for thinking for speakers."],"author":["Goldin-Meadow, S"],"keywords":["litsurvey.bib"],"pages":["419–429"],"title":["The role of gesture in communication and thinking"],"volume":[3],"year":[1999]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Goldin-Meadow","firstName":"S"}]}},{"key":"Golovchinsky2009","type":"inproceedings","fields":{"address":["New York, NY, USA"],"author":["Golovchinsky, Gene","Qvarfordt, Pernilla","van Melle, Bill","Carter, Scott","Dunnigan, Tony"],"booktitle":["Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on human factors in computing systems"],"institution":["ACM"],"keywords":["ubiquitous computing","smart environments","usability","litsurvey.bib"],"location":["Boston, MA, USA"],"month":["#apr#"],"pages":["1015–1024"],"publisher":["Association for Computing Machinery"],"series":["CHI '09"],"title":["DICE: designing conference rooms for usability"],"year":[2009]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Golovchinsky","firstName":"Gene"},{"lastName":"Qvarfordt","firstName":"Pernilla"},{"lastName":"van Melle","firstName":"Bill"},{"lastName":"Carter","firstName":"Scott"},{"lastName":"Dunnigan","firstName":"Tony"}]},"sentenceCased":true},{"key":"Goodwin2000","type":"article","fields":{"abstract":["A theory of action must come to terms with both the details of language use and the way in which the social, cultural, material and sequential structure of the environment where action occurs figure into its organization. In this paper it will be suggested that a primordial site for the analysis of human language, cognition, and action consists of a situation in which multiple participants are attempting to carry out courses of action in concert with each other through talk while attending to both the larger activities that their current actions are ambedded within, and relevant phenomena in their surround. Using as data video recordings of young girls playing hopscotch and archaeologists classifying color, it will be argued that human action is built throught the simultaneous deployment of a range of quite different kinds of semiotic resources. Talk itself contains multiple sign systems with alternative properties. Strips of talk gain their power as social action via their placement within larger sequential structures, encompassing activities, and participation frameworks constituted through displays of mutual orientation made by the actors' bodies. The body is used in a quite different way to perform gesture, again a class of phenomena that encompasses structurally different types of sign systems. Both talk and gesture can index, construe or treat as irrelevant, entities in the participants' surround. Moreover, material structure in the surround, such as graphic fields of various types, can provide semiotic structure without which the constitution of particular kinds of action being invoked through talk would be impossible. In brief it will be argued that the construction of action through talk within situated interaction is accomplished through the temporally unfolding juxtaposition of quite different kinds of semiotic resources, and that moreover through this process the human body is made publicly visible as the site for a range of structurally different kinds of displays implicated in the constitution of the actions of the moment."],"author":["Goodwin, Charles"],"journal":["J.

Despite the importance of theory, questions relating to its form and structure are neglected in comparison with questions relating to epistemology. The essay addresses issues of causality, explanation, prediction, and generalization that underlie an understanding of theory. A taxonomy is proposed that classifies information systems theories with respect to the manner in which four central goals are addressed: analysis, explanation, prediction, and prescription. Five interrelated types of theory are distinguished: (1) theory for analyzing, (2) theory for explaining, (3) theory for predicting, (4) theory for explaining and predicting, and (5) theory for design and action. Examples illustrate the nature of each theory type. The applicability of the taxonomy is demonstrated by classifying a sample of journal articles. The paper contributes by showing that multiple views of theory exist and by exposing the assumptions underlying different viewpoints. In addition, it is suggested that the type of theory under development can influence the choice of an epistemological approach. Support is given for the legitimacy and value of each theory type.

While considerable work has been done to examine interaction in desktop-based collaborative virtual environments (CVEs), there are currently no studies for collaborative interaction using IPTs. The aim of this paper is to examine how immersive technologies support interaction and to compare this to the experience with desktop systems. A study of collaboration is presented where two partners worked together using networked IPT environments. The data collected included observations, analysis of video and audio recordings, questionnaires and debriefing interviews from both IPT sites. This paper focuses on the successes and failures in collaboration through detailed examination of particular incidents during the interaction. We compare these successes and failures with the findings of a study by Hindmarsh, Fraser, Heath, & Benford (Computer Supported Collaborative Work, CSCW'98, 1998, pp. 217?226) that examined object-focused interaction on a desktop-based CVE system. Our findings identify situations where interaction is better supported with the IPT system than the desktop system, and situations where interaction is not as well supported. We also present examples of how social interaction is critical to seamless collaboration."],"author":["Heldal, Ilona","Steed, Anthony","Spante, Maria","Schroeder, Ralph","Bengtsson, Sophia","Partanen, Marja"],"journal":["Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments"],"keywords":["litsurvey.bib"],"month":["#oct#"],"number":[5],"pages":["563–579"],"publisher":["MIT Press"],"title":["Successes and failures in Co-Present situations"],"volume":[14],"year":[2005]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Heldal","firstName":"Ilona"},{"lastName":"Steed","firstName":"Anthony"},{"lastName":"Spante","firstName":"Maria"},{"lastName":"Schroeder","firstName":"Ralph"},{"lastName":"Bengtsson","firstName":"Sophia"},{"lastName":"Partanen","firstName":"Marja"}]},"sentenceCased":true},{"key":"Heldner2010","type":"article","fields":{"abstract":["This paper explores durational aspects of pauses, gaps and overlaps in three different conversational corpora with a view to challenge claims about precision timing in turn-taking. Distributions of pause, gap and overlap durations in conversations are presented, and methodological issues regarding the statistical treatment of such distributions are discussed. The results are related to published minimal response times for spoken utterances and thresholds for detection of acoustic silences in speech. It is shown that turn-taking is generally less precise than is often claimed by researchers in the field of conversation analysis or interactional linguistics. These results are discussed in the light of their implications for models of timing in turn-taking, and for interaction control models in speech technology. In particular, it is argued that the proportion of speaker changes that could potentially be triggered by information immediately preceding the speaker change is large enough for reactive interaction controls models to be viable in speech technology."],"author":["Heldner, Mattias","Edlund, Jens"],"journal":["J.

A set of multiview colour images of a person is captured from the front, sides and back by one or more cameras. Model-based reconstruction of shape from silhouettes is used to transform a standard 3D generic humanoid model to approximate a person's shape and anatomical structure. Realistic appearance is achieved by colour texture mapping from the multiview images. The results show the reconstruction of a realistic 3D facsimile of the person suitable for animation in a virtual world. The system is inexpensive and is reliable for large variations in shape, size and clothing. This is the first approach to achieve realistic model capture for clothed people and automatic reconstruction of animated models.

Both internal (mental) and external (physical or digital) representations are considered. It is discovered that both types of representation are deeply linked to thought processes. They are linked to learning, the ability to use existing knowledge, and problem solving strategies. The links between representations, thought processes, and behavior are so deep that even eye movements are partly governed by representations. Choice of representations can affect limited cognitive resources like attention and short-term memory by forcing a person to try to utilize poorly organized information or perform `translations' from one representation to another. The implications of this evidence are discussed. Based on these findings, a set of guidelines are presented, for digital representations which minimize drain of cognitive resources. These guidelines describe what sorts of characteristics and behaviors a representation should exhibit, and what sorts of information it should contain in order to accommodate and facilitate design.

One issue is whether there are universal aspects to affect expression perception and recognition models or if they are affected by human factors such as culture. Next, we discuss the difference between form and movement information as studies have shown that they are governed by separate pathways in the brain. We also review psychological studies that have investigated bodily configurations to evaluate if specific features can be identified that contribute to the recognition of specific affective states. The survey then turns to automatic affect recognition systems using body expressions as at least one input modality.

The second part is an extended treatment of possible solutions for social dilemmas. These solutions are organized into three broad categories based on whether the solutions assume egoistic actors and whether the structure of the situation can be changed: Motivational solutions assume actors are not completely egoistic and so give some weight to the outcomes of their partners. Strategic solutions assume egoistic actors, and neither of these categories of solutions involve changing the fundamental structure of the situation.

The primary function of conversational hand gestures is to aid in the formulation of speech. Gestures can convey nonsemantic information. The study of speech and gestures overlaps with the study of person perception and attribution processes. The significance of gestures can be ambiguous and will affect the meanings and consequences to the observed gestures. A topology of gestures is adopters, symbolic gestures, and conversational gestures. Different types of conversational gestures can be distinguished as—namely, motor movements and lexical movements. Conversational hand gestures have been assumed to convey semantic information. Several studies that attempt to assess the kinds of information conversational gestures convey to naive observers and the extent to which gestures enhance the communicativeness of spoken messages are described in the chapter."],"author":["Krauss, Robert M","Chen, Yihsiu","Chawla, Purnima"],"booktitle":["Advances in experimental social psychology"],"editor":["Zanna, Mark P"],"keywords":["litsurvey.bib"],"month":["#jan#"],"pages":["389–450"],"publisher":["Academic Press"],"title":["Nonverbal behavior and nonverbal communication: What do conversational hand gestures tell us?"],"volume":[28],"year":[1996]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Krauss","firstName":"Robert M"},{"lastName":"Chen","firstName":"Yihsiu"},{"lastName":"Chawla","firstName":"Purnima"}],"editor":[{"lastName":"Zanna","firstName":"Mark P"}]},"sentenceCased":true},{"key":"Kristoffersson2013","type":"article","fields":{"language":["en"],"abstract":["Mobile robotic telepresence (MRP) systems incorporate video conferencing equipment onto mobile robot devices which can be steered from remote locations.

In Experiments 1 and 2, head and gaze cues showed symmetrical interference effects. Compared with congruent arrangements, incongruent head cues slowed responses to gaze cues, and incongruent gaze cues slowed responses to head cues, suggesting that head and gaze are mutually influential in the analysis of social attention direction. This mutuality was also evident in a cross-modal version of the task (Experiment 3) where participants responded to spoken directional words whilst ignoring the head/gaze images.

In general, identifying a nonconvex object using a silhouette-based approach implies neglecting some features of its surface as identification clues. The same features cannot be reconstructed by volume intersection techniques using multiple silhouettes of the object. This paper addresses the problem of finding which parts of a nonconvex object are relevant for silhouette-based image understanding. For this purpose, the geometric concept of visual hull of a 3-D object is introduced. This is the closest approximation of object S that can be obtained with the volume intersection approach; it is the maximal object silhouette-equivalent to S, i.e., which can be substituted for S without affecting any silhouette. Only the parts of the surface of S that also lie on the surface of the visual hull can be reconstructed or identified using silhouette-based algorithms. The visual hull depends not only on the object but also on the region allowed to the viewpoint. Two main viewing regions result in the external and internal visual hull. In the former case the viewing region is related to the convex hull of S, in the latter it is bounded by S. The internal visual hull also admits an interpretation not related to silhouettes. Algorithms for computing visual hulls are presented and their complexity analyzed. In general, the visual hull of a 3-D planar face object turns out to be bounded by planar and curved patches."],"author":["Laurentini, A"],"journal":["IEEE Trans. Pattern Anal. Mach.

First of all, the feature points on the head in the head-centered coordinate system and their image projections are used to determine a transformation matrix. Then, the camera position and orientations are extracted from the matrix. Finally, the 3D coordinates of the head points expressed in the camera-centered coordinate system are obtained. Starting from the coordinates of the neck, which is a head feature point, the 3D coordinates of other joints one-by-one are determined under the assumption of the fixed lengths of the body segments. A binary interpretation tree is used to represent the 2n - 1 possible body structures, if a human body has n joints. To determine the final feasible body structures, physical and motion constraints are used to prune the interpretation tree. Formulas and rules required for the tree pruning are formulated.

It focuses on users' experiences of media, with no reference to objective system parameters.

Relations between the factors and the consistency of the factor structure with others reported in the literature are discussed. Preliminary analyses described here demonstrate that the ITC-SOPI is reliable and valid, but more rigorous testing of its psychometric properties and applicability to interactive virtual environments is required.

It was anticipated that gaze direction would moderate the efficiency of the mental operations through which these social-cognitive products are generated. Specifically, eye gaze was expected to influence both the speed with which targets could be categorized as men and women and the rate at which associated stereotypic material could be accessed from semantic memory. The results of two experiments supported these predictions: Targets with nondeviated (i.e., direct) eye gaze elicited facilitated categorical responses.

To realize the real-time processing, we first introduce a plane-based volume intersection algorithm: first represent an observable 3-D space by a group of parallel plane slices, then back-project observed multiview object silhouettes onto each slice, and finally apply two-dimensional silhouette intersection on each slice. Then, we propose a method to parallelize this algorithm using a PC cluster, where we employ five-stage pipeline processing in each PC as well as slice-by-slice parallel silhouette intersection. Several results of the quantitative performance evaluation are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

A practical and accurate technique for solving this problem from profiles alone is developed. It is precise enough to reconstruct the shape of the object. No correspondences between points or lines are necessary. Symmetry of the surface of revolution swept out by the rotating object is exploited to obtain the image of the rotation axis and the homography relating epipolar lines in two views robustly and elegantly. These, together with geometric constraints for images of rotating objects, are used to obtain first the image of the horizon, which is the projection of the plane that contains the camera centers, and then the epipoles, thus fully determining the epipolar geometry of the image sequence. The estimation of this geometry by this sequential approach avoids many of the problems found in other algorithms. The search for the epipoles, by far the most critical step, is carried out as a simple 1D optimization. Parameter initialization is trivial and completely automatic at all stages. After the estimation of the epipolar geometry, the Euclidean motion is recovered using the fixed intrinsic parameters of the camera obtained either from a calibration grid or from self-calibration techniques. Finally, the spinning object is reconstructed from its profiles using the motion estimated in the previous stage.

We propose a modification of the initialization of the DHMMs in order to better capture the recurrent structure of the sensory-motor states. We show that the explicit state duration modeling by discrete hidden semi markov models (DHSMMs) improves prediction performance. We applied these models to parallel speech and gaze data collected from interacting dyads. The challenge was to predict the gaze of one subject given the gaze of the interlocutor and the voice activity of both. For both DHMMs and DHSMMs the short-time Viterbi concept is used for incremental decoding and prediction. For the proposed models we evaluated objectively several properties in order to go beyond pure classification performance. Results show that incremental DHMMs (IDHMMs) were more efficient than classic classifiers and superseded by incremental DHSMMs (IDHSMMs).

In a shape-from-silhouette based system, images are captured at the same moment to ensure the position of the object is consistent in all frames. Differences in position between captured frames results in deformations such as holes and missing or extended features. By capturing images of a projected clock, we can tell with around 10ms granularity, how closely together images are captured.

Video conferencing either does not attempt to support eye gaze (e.g. AcessGrid) or only approximates it in round table conditions (e.g. life size telepresence). Immersive collaborative virtual environments represent remote participants through avatars that follow their tracked movements. By additionally tracking people's eyes and representing their movement on their avatars, the line of gaze can be faithfully reproduced, as opposed to approximated. This paper presents the results of initial work that tested if the focus of gaze could be more accurately gauged if tracked eye movement was added to that of the head of an avatar observed in an immersive VE. An experiment was conducted to assess the difference between user's abilities to judge what objects an avatar is looking at with only head movements being displayed, while the eyes remained static, and with eye gaze and head movement information being displayed. The results from the experiment show that eye gaze is of vital importance to the subjects correctly identifying what a person is looking at in an immersive virtual environment. This is followed by a description of the work that is now being undertaken following the positive results from the experiment. We discuss the integration of an eye tracker more suitable for immersive mobile use and the software and techniques that were developed to integrate the user's real-world eye movements into calibrated eye gaze in an immersive virtual world. This is to be used in the creation of an immersive collaborative virtual environment supporting eye gaze and its ongoing experiments.

Following the Hawthorne studies, various explanations have been proposed to account for rising rates of production. Although in the Relay Assembly Test Room experiment the experimental operations may have produced other extraneous variables, a reexamination based on new and neglected evidence has yielded a new interpretation. The new variable, made more plausible because research in other contexts has shown it to have similar effects, is a combination of information feedback and financial reward. It is an example of the control of behavior by its consequences. Although several approaches may be taken to explain the effects of response-consequence contingencies, I have favored operant conditioning because it seems to account for progressive increases in response rate-the Hawthorne phenomenon. Generalizing from the particular situation at Hawthorne, I would define the Hawthorne effect as the confounding that occurs if experimenters fail to realize how the consequences of subjects' performance affect what subjects do. But the Hawthorne effect need not be viewed solely as a problem in conducting experiments. The phenomenon that created it should be studied in its own right, as Sommer (67) suggested with a different phenomenon in mind.

We exploit the mirror symmetry property and derive a common homography that relates silhouettes with epipoles under circular motion. With the epipoles determined, the homography can be computed from the frontier points induced by epipolar tangencies. On the other hand, given the homography, the epipoles can be located directly from the bi-tangent lines of silhouettes. With the homography recovered, the image invariants under circular motion and camera parameters can be determined. If the epipoles are not available, camera parameters can be determined by a low-dimensional search of the optimal homography in a bounded region. In the degenerate case, when the camera optical axes intersect at one point, we derive a closed-form solution for the focal length to solve the problem. By using the proposed algorithm, we can achieve camera calibration simply from silhouettes of three images captured under circular motion.

Typically, these techniques depend on view-dependent texture mapping to render the textured 3D models in which the texture of novel views is synthesized at runtime according to different view-points. This is computationally expensive and limits their application in domains where efficient computations are required, such as games and virtual reality. In this paper we present an offline technique for creating view-independent texture atlases for 3D models, given a set of registered images. The best texture map resolution is computed by considering the areas of the projected polygons in the images. Texture maps are generated by a weighted composition of all available image information in the scene.Assuming that all surfaces of the model are exhibiting Lambertian reflectance properties, ray-tracing is then employed, for creating the view-independent texture maps. Finally, all the generated texture maps are packed into texture atlases. The result is a 3D model with an associated view-independent texture atlas which can be used efficiently in any application without any knowledge of camera pose information."],"address":["Beijing"],"author":["Poullis, C","You, S","Neumann, U"],"booktitle":["2007 IEEE international conference on multimedia and expo"],"keywords":["image texture","ray tracing","rendering (computer graphics)","virtual reality","high-resolution textures","3D virtual environments","view-independent texture mapping","image based modeling","rendering","games","virtual reality","3D models","texture map resolution","image information","Lambertian reflectance properties","ray tracing","Virtual environment","Rendering (computer graphics)","Visualization","Runtime","Virtual reality","Image resolution","Surface texture","Reflectivity","Ray tracing","Cameras","litsurvey.bib"],"month":["#jul#"],"pages":["1295–1298"],"title":["Generating High-Resolution textures for 3D virtual environments using View-Independent texture mapping"],"year":[2007]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Poullis","firstName":"C"},{"lastName":"You","firstName":"S"},{"lastName":"Neumann","firstName":"U"}]},"sentenceCased":true},{"key":"ProjectionMappingCentral_undated-dj","type":"unpublished","fields":{"author":["ProjectionMappingCentral"],"keywords":["litsurvey.bib"],"title":["History of projection mapping"]},"creators":{"author":[{"literal":"ProjectionMappingCentral"}]}},{"key":"Qing-xi2009","type":"inproceedings","fields":{"abstract":["In this paper, we propose and develop an interactive system based on ARtoolKit, which can be employed to pick up points in spatial environment.

Interpersonal distance, gaze, posture and facial expression, are interpreted together to manage and add meaning to most conversations. Yet today's technologies favor some above others. This induces confusion in conversations, and is believed to limit both feelings of togetherness and trust, and growth of empathy and rapport. Solving this problem will allow technologies to support most rather than a few interactional scenarios. It is likely to benefit teamwork and team cohesion, distributed decision-making and health and wellbeing applications such as tele-therapy, tele-consultation, and isolation. We introduce withyou, our telepresence research platform. This paper describes the end-to-end system including the psychology of human interaction and how this drives requirements throughout the design and implementation. Our technology approach is to combine the winning characteristics of video conferencing and immersive collaborative virtual environments. This is to allow, for example, people walking past each other to exchange a glance and smile. A systematic explanation of the theory brings together the linked nature of non-verbal communication and how it is influenced by technology. This leads to functional requirements for telepresence, in terms of the balance of visual, spatial and temporal qualities. The first end-to-end description of withyou describes all major processes and the display and capture environment. An unprecedented characterization of our approach is given in terms of the above qualities and what influences them. This leads to non-functional requirements in terms of number and place of cameras and the avoidance of resultant bottlenecks. Proposals are given for improved distribution of processes across networks, computers, and multi-core CPU and GPU. Simple conservative estimation shows that both approaches should meet our requirements. One is implemented and shown to meet minimum and come close to desirable requirements."],"author":["Roberts, D J","Fairchild, A J","Campion, S P","O'Hare, J","Moore, C M","Aspin, R","Duckworth, T","Gasparello, P","Tecchia, F"],"journal":["IEEE J.

The scene is set by explaining why Immersive Virtuality Telepresence has the potential to meet the grand challenge of faithfully communicating both the appearance and the focus of attention of a remote human participant within a shared 3D computer-supported context. Within the experiment n=22 participants rotated static 3D virtuality humans, reconstructed from surround images, until they felt most looked at. The dependent variable was absolute angular error, which was compared to that underpinning social gaze behaviour in the natural world. Independent variables were 1) relative orientations of eye, head and body of captured subject; and 2) subset of cameras used to texture the form. Analysis looked for statistical and practical significance and qualitative corroborating evidence. The analysed results tell us much about the importance and detail of the relationship between gaze pose, method of video based reconstruction, and camera arrangement. They tell us that virtuality can reproduce gaze to an accuracy useful in social interaction, but with the adopted method of Video Based Reconstruction, this is highly dependent on combination of gaze pose and camera arrangement. This suggests changes in the VBR approach in order to allow more flexible camera arrangements. The work is of interest to those wanting to support expressive meetings that are both socially and spatially situated, and particular those using or building Immersive Virtuality Telepresence to accomplish this. It is also of relevance to the use of virtuality humans in applications ranging from the study of human interactions to gaming and the crossing of the stage line in films and TV."],"author":["Roberts, David J","Rae, John","Duckworth, Tobias W","Moore, Carl M","Aspin, Rob"],"journal":["IEEE Trans.

People come together to share and discuss ideas, split and distribute work or help and support each other. The sharing of information and artefacts is a central part of collaboration. This often involves the manipulation of shared objects, both sequentially as well as concurrently. For coordinating an efficient collaboration, communication between the team members is necessary. This can happen verbally in form of speech or text and non-verbally through gesturing, pointing, gaze or facial expressions and the referencing and manipulation of shared objects. Collaborative Virtual Environments (CVE) allow remote users to come together and interact with each other and virtual objects within a computer simulated environment. Immersive display interfaces, such as a walk-in display (e.g. CAVE), that place a human physically into the synthetic environment, lend themselves well to support a natural manipulation of objects as well a set of natural non-verbal human communication, as they can both capture and display human movement. Communication of tracking data, however, can saturate the network and result in delay or loss of messages vital to the manipulation of shared objects. This paper investigates the reality of shared object manipulation between remote users collaborating through linked walk-in displays and extends our research in [27]. Various forms of shared interaction are examined through a set of structured sub tasks within a representative construction task. We report on extensive user-trials between three walk-in displays in the UK and Austria linked over the Internet using a CVE, and demonstrate such effects on a naive implementation of a benchmark application, the Gazebo building task. We then present and evaluate application-level workarounds and conclude by suggesting solutions that may be implemented within next-generation CVE infrastructures."],"author":["Roberts, David J","Wolff, Robin","Otto, Oliver"],"journal":["Comput.

Experimental methods typically involve a significant level of abstraction from reality, with participants required to carry out tasks that are far removed from violence in real life, and hence their ecological validity is questionable. On the other hand studies based on field data, while having ecological validity, cannot control multiple confounding variables that may have an impact on observed results, so that their internal validity is questionable. It is argued that immersive virtual reality may provide a unification of these two approaches. Since people tend to respond realistically to situations and events that occur in virtual reality, and since virtual reality simulations can be completely controlled for experimental purposes, studies of responses to violence within virtual reality are likely to have both ecological and internal validity. This depends on a property that we call 'plausibility' - including the fidelity of the depicted situation with prior knowledge and expectations. We illustrate this with data from a previously published experiment, a virtual reprise of Stanley Milgram's 1960s obedience experiment, and also with pilot data from a new study being developed that looks at bystander responses to violent incidents."],"author":["Rovira, Aitor","Swapp, David","Spanlang, Bernhard","Slater, Mel"],"journal":["Front.

Data were based on a field study in which 51 regular meetings were videotaped and coded with act4teams. Analyses revealed that compared with dysfunctional networks, functional interaction is less centralized and has a positive effect on team performance.

The purpose of the experiment was not to examine task performance, but to compare various aspects of the social relations among the group members in the two environments. Ten groups of three people each, who had never met before, met first in a shared VE and carried out a task that required the identification and solution of puzzles that were presented on pieces of paper displayed around the walls of a room. The puzzle involved identifying that the same-numbered words across all the pieces of paper formed a riddle or saying. The group continued this task for fifteen minutes, and then stopped to answer a questionnaire. The group then reconvened in the real world and continued the same task. The experiment also required one of the group members to continually monitor a particular one of the others in order to examine whether social discomfort could be generated within a VE. In each group, there was one immersed person with a head-mounted display and head-tracking and two non-immersed people who experienced the environment on a workstation display. The results suggest that the immersed person tended to emerge as the leader in the virtual group, but not in the real meeting. Group accord tended to be higher in the real meeting than in the virtual meeting. Socially conditioned responses such as embarrassment could be generated in the virtual meeting, even though the individuals were presented to one another by very simple avatars. The study also found a positive relationship between presence of being in a place and copresence - the sense of being with the other people. Accord in the group increased with presence, the performance of the group, and the presence of women in the group. The study is seen as part of a much larger planned study, for which this experiment was used to begin to understand the issues involved in comparing real and virtual meetings.

The present study investigated whether there are also age-related changes in basic aspects of social perception. Individuals' ability both to detect subtle differences in eye-gaze direction (e.g., where someone is looking in the environment) and to subsequently use these gaze cues to engage in joint attention with others was assessed. Age-related declines were found in the detection of the most subtle differences in gaze aversion. The ability to engage in joint attention by following gaze cues also declined with age. These age differences were not solely attributable to age impairments in visual perception and visual attention. The potential role of age-related neural declines in social perception problems was considered, along with the implications that age deficits in these basic social skills may have for older adults' social perception."],"author":["Slessor, Gillian","Phillips, Louise H","Bull, Rebecca"],"journal":["Psychol.

In these situations, design is fundamentally an interactive process that requires communication among users, designers, and developers. However, communication among these groups is often difficult although of paramount importance to design outcomes. Through a qualitative analysis of a house, expert system, and telecommunications network architecture and management system design situations, a descriptive model of design that characterizes communication among users, designers, and developers as they create an artifact was developed. The model describes design phases, roles, themes, and intergroup communication networks as they evolve throughout the design process and characterizes design as a process of “contested collaboration”.

In addition he reports recent experimental results: In order to determine how well we can predict a subject's focus of attention solely on the basis of his or her head orientation, he has conducted an experiment in which he recorded head and eye orientations of participants in a meeting using special tracking equipment. The results demonstrate that head orientation was a sufficient indicator of the subjects' focus target in 89% of the time. Furthermore he discusses how the neural networks used to estimate head orientation can be adapted to work in new locations and under new illumination conditions."],"address":["New York, NY, USA"],"author":["Stiefelhagen, R"],"booktitle":["Proceedings.

Surface patches are evident as connected sets of stripes whose 3D coordinates are computed by means of triangulation and constraint propagation. Object edges are detected by the intersection of surface patches or by backprojecting image edges to intersect with the patches. Two matching paradigms are given for drawing correspondence between structures in the scene representation and structures in models. Three major contributions are reported: a method for sensing object surface patches without having to solve uniquely for stripe labels; the use of both an intensity image and a striped image, allowing scenes to be represented by detected edges along with 3D surface patches; and a pose-clustering algorithm, a uniform technique to accumulate matching evidence for recognition while averaging out substantial errors of pose."],"author":["Stockman, G C","-.

The portion of the human-likeness spectrum in which such aversion is posited to occur is referred to as the “uncanny valley”. However, evidence in support of the UVH is primarily based on subjectively assessed evaluations. Thus it remains an open question as to whether there are behavioral or neurophysiological manifestations of uncanny valley effects. To address this gap in literature, we investigated the activation of the anterior prefrontal cortex (PFC) - a region of the brain associated with emotion regulation - in response to a series of robots with varying human-likeness. We hypothesized that highly human-like robots - which have been found to receive negative subjective attributions - will also elicit increased activity in the PFC versus humans or robots with lesser degrees of human-likeness in accordance with the UVH. Our results show a “valley” in brain activity in the PFC corresponding to the valley observed via subjective measures alone, thus suggesting one neural manifestation (the PFC) of uncanny valley effects and further supporting the affective response (aversion) posited to occur by the UVH. However, the results also reveal a second “uncanny valley” in prefrontal hemodynamics, which suggests that the effects (and the contributing factors) are more complex than previously understood."],"author":["Strait, M","Scheutz, M"],"booktitle":["The 23rd IEEE international symposium on robot and human interactive communication"],"institution":["IEEE"],"keywords":["humanoid robots","infrared spectroscopy","prefrontal hemodynamics","affective response","neural manifestation","brain activity","PFC versus humans","emotion regulation","anterior prefrontal cortex","uncanny valley effects","neurophysiological manifestations","human-likeness spectrum","human-like appearance","UVH","uncanny valley hypothesis","functional near infrared spectroscopy","human-like robots","user responses","Robots","Hemodynamics","Atmospheric measurements","Particle measurements","Spectroscopy","Visualization","Face","litsurvey.bib"],"month":["#aug#"],"pages":["1128–1133"],"title":["Measuring users' responses to humans, robots, and human-like robots with functional near infrared spectroscopy"],"year":[2014]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Strait","firstName":"M"},{"lastName":"Scheutz","firstName":"M"}]},"sentenceCased":true},{"key":"Sugimoto2004","type":"inproceedings","fields":{"address":["New York, NY, USA"],"author":["Sugimoto, Masanori","Hosoi, Kazuhiro","Hashizume, Hiromichi"],"booktitle":["Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on human factors in computing systems"],"institution":["ACM"],"keywords":["PDA","face-to-face collaboration","personal and shared spaces","sensing board","litsurvey.bib"],"location":["Vienna, Austria"],"month":["#apr#"],"pages":["41–48"],"publisher":["Association for Computing Machinery"],"series":["CHI '04"],"title":["Caretta: a system for supporting face-to-face collaboration by integrating personal and shared spaces"],"year":[2004]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Sugimoto","firstName":"Masanori"},{"lastName":"Hosoi","firstName":"Kazuhiro"},{"lastName":"Hashizume","firstName":"Hiromichi"}]},"sentenceCased":true},{"key":"Sullivan1998","type":"article","fields":{"author":["Sullivan, S","Ponce, J"],"journal":["IEEE Trans.

Photorefractive polymers are dynamic holographic recording materials that allow updating of images and have a wide range of applications, including optical correlation, imaging through scattering media and optical communication. To be suitable for 3D displays, photorefractive polymers need to have nearly 100% diffraction efficiency, fast writing time, hours of image persistence, rapid erasure, and large area-a combination of properties that has not been shown before. Here, we report an updatable holographic 3D display based on photorefractive polymers with such properties, capable of recording and displaying new images every few minutes.

Results indicate that IAOS depends not only on the angle between the two light source positions, but also on the mean orientation of the face. Availability of cues coded in the visual texture of the face did not affect IAOS. The most effective cue was the location of the visible outline of the face.

One group of ten subjects searched for a box in a real office environment. A second group of ten subjects carried out the same task in a virtual environment that simulated the same office. Immediately after their experience, subjects were given two different presence questionnaires in randomized order: the Witmer and Singer Presence (WS), and the questionnaire developed by Slater, Usoh, and Steed (SUS). The paper argues that questionnaires should be able to pass a “reality test,” whereby under current conditions the presence scores should be higher for real experiences than for virtual ones. Nevertheless, only the SUS had a marginally higher mean score for the real compared to the virtual, and there was no significant difference at all between the WS mean scores. It is concluded that, although such questionnaires may be useful when all subjects experience the same type of environment, their utility is doubtful for the comparison of experiences across environments, such as immersive virtual compared to real, or desktop compared to immersive virtual.

Unlike the other cues, selective gaze depends critically on the configuration of cameras and monitors. Under isotropic videoconferencing conditions people see each other in spatially consistent directions (shared video space). Isotropy is hypothesized to regulate the interactional process of conversation. Further, it is hypothesized that isotropy increases social nearness which increases persuasive force but decreases the exchange of information in group discussion tasks. We have studied the interactional process and task outcome of two discussion tasks under isotropic and (standard) non-isotropic videoconferencing conditions relative to face-to-face conditions. The communication of unshared information was tested in a `hidden profile' task by Stasser et al.[Journal of Experimental Social Psychology 31 (1995) 244]. Dominance and persuasive force were revealed using a prioritization game of survival items called `Lost at the moon', featuring a dominant confederate. The results support our hypotheses and have revealed that persuasive force (the ability to change another person's opinion) is significantly stronger under isotropic conditions (including face-to-face) than under non-isotropic conditions. In contrast, dominance (the ability to influence group solutions by dominant behavior) is similar for all conditions.

The planning, training and analysis of on-orbit servicing (OOS) missions performed by astronauts or through remote operation using a robot is often time consuming and costly. Virtual Reality (VR) enables simulation and training in a flexible and safe environment. This paper describes an interactive real-time environment that supports a number of OOS tasks within an immersive VR environment. The system simulates the dynamic and kinematic behaviour of satellite components and provides photo-realistic visualization of satellite parts and the space environment. It integrates user interaction with haptic force feedback through a bi-manual haptic human machine interface, as well as simulates and interfaces to a humanoid robot for tele-operation.In order to provide a realistic experience at interactive frame rates, we propose a distributed system architecture, where the load of computing the physics simulation, haptic feedback and visualization of the complex scene is transferred to dedicated machines. The modular architecture is designed to allow the inclusion of further simulation processes. Several mechanisms for reducing the communication traffic have been implemented. This paper gives an overview of the system architecture, outlines the software implementation and documents an evaluation of the real-time performance of our system in detail. We describe how system performance was measured in terms of simulation timings and distribution load, as well as report on latencies at several stages. Results show that our distributed system is capable of providing visual and haptic feedback at high frame rates required for user interaction with end-to-end latencies of less than 8?ms and 3?ms, respectively."],"author":["Wolff, Robin","Preusche, Carsten","Gerndt, Andreas"],"journal":["Journal of Simulation"],"keywords":["litsurvey.bib"],"month":["#feb#"],"number":[1],"pages":["50–63"],"publisher":["Taylor & Francis"],"title":["A modular architecture for an interactive real-time simulation and training environment for satellite on-orbit servicing"],"volume":[8],"year":[2014]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Wolff","firstName":"Robin"},{"lastName":"Preusche","firstName":"Carsten"},{"lastName":"Gerndt","firstName":"Andreas"}]}},{"key":"Wolff2008","type":"inproceedings","fields":{"abstract":["Eye gaze is an important conversational resource that until now could only be supported across a distance if people were rooted to the spot.

In this paper, we propose a parallel pipeline system on a PC cluster for reconstructing the 3D shape of a moving person in real-time. For the 3D shape reconstruction, we have extended the volume intersection method to the 3-base-plane volume intersection. By thus extension, the computation is accelerated greatly for arbitrary camera layouts. We also parallelized the 3-base-plane method and implemented it on a PC cluster. On each node, the pipeline processing is adopted to improve the throughput. To decrease the CPU idle time caused by I/O processing, image capturing, communications over nodes and so on, we implement the pipeline using multiple threads. So that, all stages can be executed concurrently. However, there exists resource conflicts between stages in a real system. To avoid the conflicts while keeping high percentage of CPU running time, we propose a tree structured thread control model. As a result, We achieve the performance as obtaining the full 3D volumes of a moving person at about 12 frames per second, where the voxel size is 5$×$5 [mm³]. The effectiveness of the thread tree model in such real-time computation is also proved by the experimental results."],"address":["New York"],"author":["Xiaojun Wu","Takizawa, O","Matsuyama, T"],"booktitle":["Fourth IEEE international conference on computer vision systems (ICVS'06)"],"keywords":["Shape","Pipeline processing","Image reconstruction","Yarn","Computerized monitoring","Humans","Computer vision","Motion analysis","Real time systems","Acceleration","litsurvey.bib"],"month":["#jan#"],"pages":["4–4"],"title":["Parallel pipeline volume intersection for Real-Time 3D shape reconstruction on a PC cluster"],"year":[2006]},"creators":{"author":[{"literal":"Xiaojun Wu"},{"lastName":"Takizawa","firstName":"O"},{"lastName":"Matsuyama","firstName":"T"}]},"sentenceCased":true},{"key":"Xu2012","type":"inproceedings","fields":{"address":["New York, NY, USA"],"author":["Xu, Anbang","Biehl, Jacob","Rieffel, Eleanor","Turner, Thea","van Melle, William"],"booktitle":["Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on human factors in computing systems"],"institution":["ACM"],"keywords":["affect awareness","myunity","workplace communication","affect","presence","affect computing","litsurvey.bib"],"location":["Austin, Texas, USA"],"month":["#may#"],"pages":["839–848"],"publisher":["Association for Computing Machinery"],"series":["CHI '12"],"title":["Learning how to feel again: towards affective workplace presence and communication technologies"],"year":[2012]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Xu","firstName":"Anbang"},{"lastName":"Biehl","firstName":"Jacob"},{"lastName":"Rieffel","firstName":"Eleanor"},{"lastName":"Turner","firstName":"Thea"},{"lastName":"van Melle","firstName":"William"}]},"sentenceCased":true},{"key":"Yamashita2008","type":"inproceedings","fields":{"address":["New York, NY, USA"],"author":["Yamashita, Naomi","Hirata, Keiji","Aoyagi, Shigemi","Kuzuoka, Hideaki","Harada, Yasunori"],"booktitle":["Proceedings of the 2008 ACM conference on Computer supported cooperative work"],"institution":["ACM"],"keywords":["empirical study","group-to-group meeting","computer-supported cooperative work","conversational analysis","seating position","video-mediated communication","litsurvey.bib"],"location":["San Diego, CA, USA"],"month":["#nov#"],"pages":["177–186"],"publisher":["Association for Computing Machinery"],"series":["CSCW '08"],"title":["Impact of seating positions on group video communication"],"year":[2008]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Yamashita","firstName":"Naomi"},{"lastName":"Hirata","firstName":"Keiji"},{"lastName":"Aoyagi","firstName":"Shigemi"},{"lastName":"Kuzuoka","firstName":"Hideaki"},{"lastName":"Harada","firstName":"Yasunori"}]}},{"key":"Yang2016","type":"inproceedings","fields":{"author":["Yang, Tingting","Jia, Shuwen"],"booktitle":["2016 international computer symposium (ICS)"],"file":[":C\\:/Users/its352/Google Drive/DataVis/literature\\_repository/Data Visualisation/07858557.pdf:PDF"],"organization":["IEEE"],"pages":["660–662"],"title":["Research on network security visualization under big data environment"],"year":[2016]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Yang","firstName":"Tingting"},{"lastName":"Jia","firstName":"Shuwen"}]},"sentenceCased":true},{"key":"Yang2018","type":"article","fields":{"author":["Yang, Yalong","Dwyer, Tim","Jenny, Bernhard","Marriott, Kim","Cordeil, Maxime","Chen, Haohui"],"file":[":C\\:/Users/its352/Google Drive/DataVis/literature\\_repository/Data Visualisation/08440844.pdf:PDF"],"journal":["IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics"],"number":[1],"pages":["693–703"],"publisher":["IEEE"],"title":["Origin-destination flow maps in immersive environments"],"volume":[25],"year":[2018]},"creators":{"author":[{"lastName":"Yang","firstName":"Yalong"},{"lastName":"Dwyer","firstName":"Tim"},{"lastName":"Jenny","firstName":"Bernhard"},{"lastName":"Marriott","firstName":"Kim"},{"lastName":"Cordeil","firstName":"Maxime"},{"lastName":"Chen","firstName":"Haohui"}]}},{"key":"Yee2007","type":"inproceedings","fields":{"abstract":["Every day, millions of users interact in real-time via avatars in online environments, such as massively-multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs).

The newer one is capable of displaying 3D color video images within a 200-mm diameter and a 256-mm height. Images have a resolution of 1254 circumferential pixels and 256 vertical pixels, and are refreshed at 30Hz. Each pixel has a viewing angle of 60 degrees that is divided into over 70 views so that the angular parallax interval of each pixel is less than 1 degree. These pixels are arranged on a cylindrical surface to allow for the produced 3D images to be observed from all directions.

In common with many writers then and now, he believed that the evolutionary past is conserved in the mind and the brain. Today the “evolutionary Freud” is nearly forgotten. Even among Freudians, he is regarded to be a red herring, relevant only to the extent that he diverts attention from the enduring achievements of the authentic Freud. There are three ways to explain these attitudes. First, the evolutionary Freud's key work is the “Overview of the Transference Neurosis” (1915). But it was published at an inopportune moment, forty years after the author's death, during the so-called “Freud wars.” Second, Freud eventually lost interest in the “Overview” and the prospect of a comprehensive evolutionary theory of psychopathology. The publication of The Ego and the Id (1923), introducing Freud's structural theory of the psyche, marked the point of no return. Finally, Freud's evolutionary theory is simply not credible. It is based on just-so stories and a thoroughly discredited evolutionary mechanism, Lamarckian use-inheritance. Explanations one and two are probably correct but also uninteresting. Explanation number three assumes that there is a fundamental difference between Freud's evolutionary narratives (not credible) and the evolutionary accounts of psychopathology that currently circulate in psychiatry and mainstream journals (credible).

Estimating depth from stereo is a classic computer vision problem, which has received tremendous attention since the early days. Recovering 3D information from a pair of stereo cameras has been a popular topic because the additional 3D information provided by this technology contains significantly more information than 2D information produced by traditional cameras. Some believe that this technology will fundamentally revolutionize the computer vision signal-processing pipeline, as well as how future cameras will be built. The current implementation achieves 36 Hz stereo matching on 1024 × 768 stereo video with a fine 256-pixel disparity range. The focus of this work is to provide efficient high-resolution stereo algorithms for real-time applications in which only foreground moving objects are of interest, such as motion capture, object tracking, and recognition and identification in a surveillance scenario."],"address":["Boston"],"author":["Zhao, Yong","Taubin, Gabriel"],"booktitle":["GPU computing gems emerald
