# Bots Visualization Debug Summary

## Current Status
- ✅ Backend integration working (claude-flow MCP connected, agent_list being called)
- ✅ Frontend receiving data (shows "8 live agents and 8 links")
- ✅ UI restored (added "New Swarm Task" button)
- ❌ 3D visualization not rendering agents

## Fixes Applied

### 1. UI Fix - Restored Swarm Controls
Added "New Swarm Task" button to IntegratedControlPanel that appears even when agents exist:
```typescript
<button onClick={() => setShowSwarmPrompt(true)}>
  New Swarm Task
</button>
```

### 2. Debug Logging Added
Added visualization state logging to track:
- Node count
- Edge count  
- Position count
- Data source
- First node position

### 3. Test Cube Added
Added a red test cube at origin that should appear when nodes exist to verify Three.js rendering.

## Debugging Steps

1. **Check Browser Console** for:
   - `[VISIONFLOW] Visualization render state:` logs
   - Any Three.js errors
   - Position initialization logs

2. **Verify Test Cube** - You should see a red 5x5x5 cube at the origin if nodes exist

3. **Check Camera Position** - The camera might be looking at the wrong location

## Next Steps

If the red test cube doesn't appear:
- Three.js scene issue
- Component not mounting properly
- Canvas rendering problem

If the test cube appears but no agents:
- Position initialization issue
- Agent rendering logic problem
- Material/geometry issue

## Quick Fix Commands

To reset and try again:
1. Refresh the browser (Ctrl+R)
2. Open developer console (F12)
3. Look for VISIONFLOW logs
4. Click "New Swarm Task" to initialize a new swarm
