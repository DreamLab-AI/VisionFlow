The Goal of Integration MAJOR NEW FEATURE OPTION

The integration aims to create a two-part system: an offline construction pipeline that builds the knowledge base, and an online retrieval pipeline that uses it.

Phase 1: The "Construction" Pipeline (Offline Process)
This phase uses the kg_construction crate to process your source documents and populate both the vector store and a Neo4j graph database.
Goal: Convert unstructured data into a hybrid knowledge base of embeddings and a structured graph.
Data Ingestion and Chunking:
Use the utilities in utils/src/file_io.rs and utils/src/csv_processing.rs to load your raw data.
The kg_construction/src/chunker.rs module will break down large documents into manageable pieces for the LLM.
Knowledge Extraction (LLM-Powered):
This is the core of kg_construction. The KnowledgeGraphExtractor (extractor.rs) orchestrates this process.
It uses the llm_generator crate with specialized prompts from prompts.rs to make the LLM read text chunks and output structured JSON containing entities and relationships (triples).
The OutputParser (parser.rs) then cleans and validates this LLM output.
Dual Storage:
Vector Store: The original text chunks (or summaries) are embedded and stored in your vectorstore. This provides the semantic search capability for the first step of retrieval.
Knowledge Graph: The extracted triples (e.g., (Entity: Steve Jobs)-[Relation: founded]->(Entity: Apple Inc.)) are loaded into a Neo4j database. The kg_construction/neo4j/ directory contains everything needed for this, especially the BatchProcessor (batch.rs) for efficient, large-scale data loading.
Phase 2: The "Retrieval" Pipeline (Online Graph-RAG)
This is where you enhance your existing RAG flow by integrating the knowledge graph at query time. The retriever crate is designed for exactly this.
Goal: Answer a user query using the rich, interconnected context from both the vector store and the knowledge graph.
Initial Retrieval (Seed Finding):
When a user query comes in, the first step is the same as standard RAG.
Use your vectorstore to perform a semantic search on the query to find the top-k most relevant text chunks. These chunks serve as the "entry points" or "seeds" for graph exploration.
Entity Linking:
From the retrieved text chunks, identify key entities (e.g., "Apple Inc.", "Steve Jobs") that are also nodes in your Neo4j knowledge graph.
Graph Traversal (The "Multi-Hop" Step):
This is the crucial enhancement. Using the entities identified in the previous step as starting points, use the MultiHopRetriever from retriever/src/retriever.rs.
This component, powered by logic in retriever/src/graph.rs, traverses the Neo4j graph to find highly relevant, interconnected facts. For example, starting from "Apple Inc.", it might find relationships like (Apple Inc.)-[:located_in]->(Cupertino) and (Apple Inc.)-[:develops]->(iPhone).
This step uncovers crucial context that might not have been in the top-k vector search results but is highly relevant to the entities mentioned.
Context Assembly and Generation:
The retriever/src/context.rs module assembles a final, enriched context window. This context now contains both the original unstructured text chunks and the structured triples from the graph traversal.
This powerful, hybrid context is passed to your llm_generator. The prompt should be engineered to instruct the LLM to synthesize an answer by reasoning over the provided facts and relationships.
Phase 3: Advanced Integration and Optimization
Your repository contains even more advanced features you can integrate for a state-of-the-art system.
Concept Generation:
The kg_construction/src/concept_generation.rs module can be used to add another layer of abstraction to your graph. It uses an LLM to categorize entities into higher-level concepts (e.g., "Apple Inc." -> "Technology Company", "iPhone" -> "Consumer Electronics").
Benefit: This allows the retriever to answer broader questions. A query about "tech companies" could now successfully retrieve information about Apple, even if the source text never used that exact phrase.
Performance and Testing:
Leverage the Test Suite: The repository has a world-class testing infrastructure (tests/, scripts/, .github/workflows/ci.yml). Use the integration and property tests to validate that your combined system is robust and correct.
Use Benchmarks: The benches/ directories contain performance benchmarks. Use these to tune parameters like batch sizes, connection pools, and embedding dimensions for optimal speed and resource usage, as detailed in docs/PERFORMANCE.md.
Implementation Example (Putting it all together)
The file autoschema_kg_rust/examples/basic_usage.rs provides an excellent template for the final integrated application. Here is a conceptual breakdown of how it would work:
code
Rust
// This conceptual code is based on your `examples/basic_usage.rs`
use autoschema_kg_rust::{
    kg_construction::{KnowledgeGraphBuilder, GraphConfig},
    retriever::{MultiHopRetriever, RetrieverConfig},
    llm_generator::{LLMGenerator, OpenAIProvider, GenerationConfig},
    vectorstore::{VectorStore, EmbeddingConfig},
};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // --- OFFLINE CONSTRUCTION (This would be a separate process) ---
    // 1. Initialize KG builder to connect to Neo4j
    let kg_config = GraphConfig::builder().neo4j_uri("bolt://localhost:7687").build();
    let kg_builder = KnowledgeGraphBuilder::new(kg_config).await?;

    // 2. Process source data to extract triples and populate Neo4j
    // kg_builder.process_dataset("path/to/data.csv", processing_config).await?;
    println!("Offline: Knowledge Graph has been constructed and stored in Neo4j.");

    // --- ONLINE RETRIEVAL (This is your main application loop) ---

    // 1. Initialize all components for the retrieval pipeline
    let vector_store = VectorStore::new(EmbeddingConfig::default()).await?;
    let retriever_config = RetrieverConfig::builder().max_hops(3).build();
    let retriever = MultiHopRetriever::new(
        retriever_config,
        vector_store, // Used for initial seed finding
        kg_builder.graph_client(), // Neo4j client for graph traversal
    ).await?;
    let llm = LLMGenerator::new(OpenAIProvider::new("your-api-key"), GenerationConfig::default());

    // 2. Process a user query
    let query = "What are the relationships between entities in the dataset?";

    // 3. The retriever performs the Graph-RAG pipeline:
    //    - Vector search for initial chunks
    //    - Graph traversal from entities found in those chunks
    //    - Assembles a hybrid context
    let context = retriever.retrieve(query, None).await?;

    // 4. The LLM generates an answer from the rich, structured context
    let response = llm.generate_with_context(query, &context).await?;

    println!("Final Answer: {}", response.text);

    Ok(())
}
By integrating kg_construction in this way, you transform your RAG system from a simple text retriever into a powerful reasoning engine.
