## Why Archived?

These files served their purpose during the migration but are now superseded by:
1. Git commit history (complete record of migration)
2. Consolidated knowledgebase (unified source of truth)
3. Forward implementation plan (future roadmap)

Historical reference maintained for audit trail and learning.
