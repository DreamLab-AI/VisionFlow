## üö® Critical Issues

### Priority 0 (Blocker)
1. **Missing WhelkTransformerService** - Reasoning non-functional
   - Implementation: `whelk-transformer-service.rs`
   - Effort: 3-5 days
   - Impact: HIGH

### Priority 1 (High)
1. **No Caching Implementation** - 4900ms latency on every request
   - Implementation: `cache-manager-service.rs`
   - Effort: 4-7 days
   - Impact: HIGH

2. **Synchronous File I/O** - Blocks actor threads
   - Solution: Convert to tokio::fs
   - Effort: 3 days
   - Impact: HIGH

3. **Sequential Extraction** - No parallelism
   - Solution: tokio::join! for parallel extraction
   - Effort: 5 days
   - Impact: HIGH
